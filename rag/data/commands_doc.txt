COMMAND: hostnamectl

DESCRIPTION: hostnamectl - Control the system hostname

USAGE: hostnamectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

OPTIONS:
The following options are understood:

       --no-ask-password
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       --static, --transient, --pretty
           If status is invoked (or no explicit command is given) and one of
           these switches is specified, hostnamectl will print out just this
           selected hostname.

           If used with set-hostname, only the selected hostnames will be
           updated. When more than one of these switches are specified, all
           the specified hostnames will be updated.

       -H, --host=
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username
           and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may
           optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by
           ":", and then a container name, separated by "/", which connects
           directly to a specific container on the specified host. This will
           use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container
           names may be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST. Put IPv6 addresses
           in brackets.

       -M, --machine=
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
           connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to connect as and a
           separating "@" character. If the special string ".host" is used in
           place of the container name, a connection to the local system is
           made (which is useful to connect to a specific user's user bus:
           "--user --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used,
           the connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be omitted
           (but not both) in which case the local user name and ".host" are
           implied.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --json=MODE
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the
           shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace or line
           breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with
           indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the
           default).

COMMAND: dmesg

DESCRIPTION: dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

USAGE: dmesg [options]

       dmesg --clear

       dmesg --read-clear [options]

       dmesg --console-level level

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           dmesg --facility=daemon

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

           For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
           emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
           levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
           can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
           When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
           kernel ring buffer.

       --noescape
           The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
           multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
           in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
           disables this feature at all. It's usable for example for debugging
           purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don't use it by
           default.

       -P, --nopager
           Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
           --human output.

       -p, --force-prefix
           Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
           multi-line message.

       -r, --raw
           Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
           prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
           also --noescape).

           Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
           kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
           syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
           the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
           /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
           iflag=nonblock'.

       -S, --syslog
           Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
           messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
           since kernel 3.5.0.

       -s, --buffer-size size
           Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime
           Print human-readable timestamps.

           Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
           and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
           last resume.

       --since time
           Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       --until time
           Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

       --time-format format
           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
           time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
           implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
           this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
           systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
           timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds><-+><timezone
           offset from UTC>.

           The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
           inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

       -u, --userspace
           Print userspace messages.

       -w, --follow
           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new
           Wait and print only new messages.

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: dmesg

DESCRIPTION: dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

USAGE: dmesg [options]

       dmesg --clear

       dmesg --read-clear [options]

       dmesg --console-level level

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           dmesg --facility=daemon

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
COMMAND INPUT:

=== 
COMMAND: dmesg

DESCRIPTION: dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

USAGE: dmesg [options]

       dmesg --clear

       dmesg --read-clear [options]

       dmesg --console-level level

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           dmesg --facility=daemon

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

           For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
           emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
           levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
           can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
           When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
           kernel ring buffer.

       --noescape
           The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
           multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
           in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
           disables this feature at all. It's usable for example for debugging
           purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don't use it by
           default.

       -P, --nopager
           Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
           --human output.

       -p, --force-prefix
           Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
           multi-line message.

       -r, --raw
           Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
           prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
           also --noescape).

           Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
           kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
           syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
           the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
           /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
           iflag=nonblock'.

       -S, --syslog
           Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
           messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
           since kernel 3.5.0.

       -s, --buffer-size size
           Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime
           Print human-readable timestamps.

           Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
           and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
           last resume.

       --since time
           Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       --until time
           Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

       --time-format format
           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
           time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
           implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
           this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
           systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
           timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds><-+><timezone
           offset from UTC>.

           The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
           inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

       -u, --userspace
           Print userspace messages.

       -w, --follow
           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new
           Wait and print only new messages.

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime
           Print human-readable timestamps.

           Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
           and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
           last resume.

       --since time
           Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       --until time
           Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

       --time-format format
           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
           time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
           implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
           this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
           systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
           timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds><-+><timezone
           offset from UTC>.

           The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
           inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

       -u, --userspace
           Print userspace messages.

       -w, --follow
           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new
           Wait and print only new messages.

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
COMMAND INPUT:
dmesg -l mail

COMMAND OUTPUT:
dmesg: unknown level 'mail'

=== 
COMMAND: dmesg

DESCRIPTION: dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

USAGE: dmesg [options]

       dmesg --clear

       dmesg --read-clear [options]

       dmesg --console-level level

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           dmesg --facility=daemon

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

           For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
           emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
           levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
           can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
           When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
           kernel ring buffer.

       --noescape
           The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
           multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
           in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
           disables this feature at all. It's usable for example for debugging
           purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don't use it by
           default.

       -P, --nopager
           Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
           --human output.

       -p, --force-prefix
           Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
           multi-line message.

       -r, --raw
           Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
           prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
           also --noescape).

           Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
           kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
           syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
           the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
           /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
           iflag=nonblock'.

       -S, --syslog
           Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
           messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
           since kernel 3.5.0.

       -s, --buffer-size size
           Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime

           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime

           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the

           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

           For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
           emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
           levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
           can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
           When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
           kernel ring buffer.

       --noescape
           The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
           multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
           in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
           disables this feature at all. It's usable for example for debugging
           purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don't use it by
           default.

       -P, --nopager
           Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
           --human output.

       -p, --force-prefix
           Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
           multi-line message.

       -r, --raw
           Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
           prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
           also --noescape).

           Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
           kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
           syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
           the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
           /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
           iflag=nonblock'.

       -S, --syslog
           Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
           messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
           since kernel 3.5.0.

       -s, --buffer-size size
           Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime
           Print human-readable timestamps.

           Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
           and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
           last resume.

       --since time
           Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       --until time
           Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

       --time-format format
           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
           time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
           implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
           this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
           systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
           timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds><-+><timezone
           offset from UTC>.

           The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
           inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

       -u, --userspace
           Print userspace messages.

       -w, --follow
           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new
           Wait and print only new messages.

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For

       dmesg --clear

       dmesg --read-clear [options]

       dmesg --console-level level

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           dmesg --facility=daemon

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

           For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
           emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
           levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
           can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
           When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
           kernel ring buffer.

       --noescape
           The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
           multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
           in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
           disables this feature at all. It's usable for example for debugging
           purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don't use it by
           default.

       -P, --nopager
           Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
           --human output.

       -p, --force-prefix
           Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
           multi-line message.

       -r, --raw
           Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
           prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
           also --noescape).

           Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
           kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
           syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
           the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
           /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
           iflag=nonblock'.

       -S, --syslog
           Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
           messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
           since kernel 3.5.0.

       -s, --buffer-size size
           Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime
           Print human-readable timestamps.

           Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
           and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
           last resume.

       --since time
           Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       --until time
           Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

       --time-format format
           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
           time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
           implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
           this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
           systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
           timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds><-+><timezone
           offset from UTC>.

           The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
           inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

       -u, --userspace
           Print userspace messages.

       -w, --follow
           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new
           Wait and print only new messages.

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: findmnt

DESCRIPTION: findmnt - find a filesystem

USAGE: findmnt [options]

       findmnt [options] device|mountpoint

       findmnt [options] [--source] device [--target path|--mountpoint
       mountpoint]

OPTIONS:
-A, --all
           Disable all built-in filters and print all filesystems.

       -a, --ascii
           Use ascii characters for tree formatting.

       -b, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit
           prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are
           exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability, by
           exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1
           MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting
           on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.

       -C, --nocanonicalize
           Do not canonicalize paths at all. This option affects the comparing
           of paths and the evaluation of tags (LABEL, UUID, etc.).

       -c, --canonicalize
           Canonicalize all printed paths.

       --deleted
           Print filesystems where target (mountpoint) is marked as deleted by
           kernel.

       -D, --df
           Imitate the output of df(1). This option is equivalent to -o
           SOURCE,FSTYPE,SIZE,USED,AVAIL,USE%,TARGET but excludes all pseudo
           filesystems. Use --all to print all filesystems.

       -d, --direction word
           The search direction, either forward or backward.

       -e, --evaluate
           Convert all tags (LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID, or PARTLABEL) to the
           corresponding device names for the SOURCE column. It's an unusual
           situation, but the same tag may be duplicated (used for more
           devices). For this purpose, there is SOURCES (pl.) column. This
           column displays by multi-line cell all devices where the tag is
           detected by libblkid. This option makes sense for fstab only.

       -F, --tab-file path
           Search in an alternative file. If used with --fstab, --mtab or
           --kernel, then it overrides the default paths. If specified more
           than once, then tree-like output is disabled (see the --list
           option).

       -f, --first-only
           Print the first matching filesystem only.

       -i, --invert
           Invert the sense of matching.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format.

       -k, --kernel
           Search in /proc/self/mountinfo. The output is in the tree-like
           format. This is the default. The output contains only mount options
           maintained by kernel (see also --mtab).

       -l, --list
           Use the list output format. This output format is automatically
           enabled if the output is restricted by the -t, -O, -S or -T option
           and the option --submounts is not used or if more that one source
           file (the option -F) is specified.

       -M, --mountpoint path
           Explicitly define the mountpoint file or directory. See also
           --target.

       -m, --mtab
           Search in /etc/mtab. The output is in the list format by default
           (see --tree). The output may include user space mount options.

       -N, --task tid
           Use alternative namespace /proc/<tid>/mountinfo rather than the
           default /proc/self/mountinfo. If the option is specified more than
           once, then tree-like output is disabled (see the --list option).
           See also the unshare(1) command.

       -n, --noheadings
           Do not print a header line.

       -O, --options list
           Limit the set of printed filesystems. More than one option may be
           specified in a comma-separated list. The -t and -O options are
           cumulative in effect. It is different from -t in that each option
           is matched exactly; a leading no at the beginning does not have
           global meaning. The "no" can used for individual items in the list.
           The "no" prefix interpretation can be disabled by "+" prefix.

       -o, --output list
           Define output columns. See the --help output to get a list of the
           currently supported columns. The TARGET column contains tree
           formatting if the --list or --raw options are not specified.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., findmnt -o +PROPAGATION).

       --output-all
           Output almost all available columns. The columns that require
           --poll are not included.

       -P, --pairs
           Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. All potentially
           unsafe value characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>). See also option
           --shell.

       -p, --poll[=list]
           Monitor changes in the /proc/self/mountinfo file. Supported actions
           are: mount, umount, remount and move. More than one action may be
           specified in a comma-separated list. All actions are monitored by
           default.

           The time for which --poll will block can be restricted with the
           --timeout or --first-only options.

           The standard columns always use the new version of the information
           from the mountinfo file, except the umount action which is based on
           the original information cached by findmnt. The poll mode allows
           using extra columns:

           ACTION
               mount, umount, move or remount action name; this column is
               enabled by default

           OLD-TARGET
               available for umount and move actions

           OLD-OPTIONS
               available for umount and remount actions

       --pseudo
           Print only pseudo filesystems.

       --shadow
           Print only filesystems over-mounted by another filesystem.

       -R, --submounts
           Print recursively all submounts for the selected filesystems. The
           restrictions defined by options -t, -O, -S, -T and --direction are
           not applied to submounts. All submounts are always printed in
           tree-like order. The option enables the tree-like output format by
           default. This option has no effect for --mtab or --fstab.

       -r, --raw
           Use raw output format. All potentially unsafe characters are
           hex-escaped (\x<code>).

       --real
           Print only real filesystems.

       -S, --source spec
           Explicitly define the mount source. Supported specifications are
           device, maj:min, LABEL=label, UUID=uuid, PARTLABEL=label and
           PARTUUID=uuid.

       -s, --fstab
           Search in /etc/fstab. The output is in the list format (see
           --list).

       -T, --target path
           Define the mount target. If path is not a mountpoint file or
           directory, then findmnt checks the path elements in reverse order
           to get the mountpoint (this feature is supported only when
           searching in kernel files and unsupported for --fstab). It's
           recommended to use the option --mountpoint when checks of path
           elements are unwanted and path is a strictly specified mountpoint.

       -t, --types list
           Limit the set of printed filesystems. More than one type may be
           specified in a comma-separated list. The list of filesystem types
           can be prefixed with no to specify the filesystem types on which no
           action should be taken. For more details see mount(8).

       --tree
           Enable tree-like output if possible. The options is silently
           ignored for tables where is missing child-parent relation (e.g.,
           fstab).

       --shadowed
           Print only filesystems over-mounted by another filesystem.

       -U, --uniq
           Ignore filesystems with duplicate mount targets, thus effectively
           skipping over-mounted mount points.

       -u, --notruncate
           Do not truncate text in columns. The default is to not truncate the
           TARGET, SOURCE, UUID, LABEL, PARTUUID, PARTLABEL columns. This
           option disables text truncation also in all other columns.

       -v, --nofsroot
           Do not print a [/dir] in the SOURCE column for bind mounts or btrfs
           subvolumes.

       -w, --timeout milliseconds
           Specify an upper limit on the time for which --poll will block, in
           milliseconds.

       -x, --verify
           Check mount table content. The default is to verify /etc/fstab
           parsability and usability. It's possible to use this option also
           with --tab-file. It's possible to specify source (device) or target
           (mountpoint) to filter mount table. The option --verbose forces
           findmnt to print more details.

       --verbose
           Force findmnt to print more information (--verify only for now).

       --vfs-all
           When used with VFS-OPTIONS column, print all VFS (fs-independent)
           flags. This option is designed for auditing purposes to list also
           default VFS kernel mount options which are normally not listed.

       -y, --shell
           The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed
           for shell variable identifiers. This is usable, for example, with
           --pairs. Note that this feature has been automatically enabled for
           --pairs in version 2.37, but due to compatibility issues, now it's
           necessary to request this behavior by --shell.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: df

DESCRIPTION: df - report file system space usage

USAGE: df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

OPTIONS:
Show  information  about the file system on which each FILE resides, or
       all file systems by default.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  options
       too.

       -a, --all
              include pseudo, duplicate, inaccessible file systems

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              scale  sizes  by  SIZE  before printing them; e.g., '-BM' prints
              sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)

       -H, --si
              print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)

       -i, --inodes
              list inode information instead of block usage

              limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE

       -v     (ignored)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Display  values  are  in  units  of  the  first  available  SIZE   from
       --block-size,  and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE environ-
       ment variables.  Otherwise, units default to  1024  bytes  (or  512  if
       POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).

       The  SIZE  argument  is  an  integer and optional unit (example: 10K is
       10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y  (powers  of  1024)  or  KB,MB,...
       (powers  of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and
       so on.

       FIELD_LIST is a comma-separated list of columns to be included.   Valid
       field  names are: 'source', 'fstype', 'itotal', 'iused', 'iavail', 'ip-
       cent', 'size', 'used', 'avail', 'pcent', 'file' and 'target' (see  info
       page).

COMMAND: mount

DESCRIPTION: mount - mount a filesystem

USAGE: mount [-h|-V]

       mount [-l] [-t fstype]

       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-O optlist]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options] device|mountpoint

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-o options] device mountpoint

       mount --bind|--rbind|--move olddir newdir

       mount
       --make-[shared|slave|private|unbindable|rshared|rslave|rprivate|runbindable]
       mountpoint

OPTIONS:
The full set of mount options used by an invocation of mount is
       determined by first extracting the mount options for the filesystem
       from the fstab table, then applying any options specified by the -o
       argument, and finally applying a -r or -w option, when present.

       The mount command does not pass all command-line options to the
       /sbin/mount.suffix mount helpers. The interface between mount and the
       mount helpers is described below in the EXTERNAL HELPERS section.

       Command-line options available for the mount command are:

       -a, --all
           Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in fstab
           (except for those whose line contains the noauto keyword). The
           filesystems are mounted following their order in fstab. The mount
           command compares filesystem source, target (and fs root for bind
           mount or btrfs) to detect already mounted filesystems. The kernel
           table with already mounted filesystems is cached during mount
           --all. This means that all duplicated fstab entries will be
           mounted.

           The correct functionality depends on /proc (to detect already
           mounted filesystems) and on /sys (to evaluate filesystem tags like
           UUID= or LABEL=). It's strongly recommended to mount /proc and /sys
           filesystems before mount -a is executed, or keep /proc and /sys at
           the beginning of fstab.

           The option --all is possible to use for remount operation too. In
           this case all filters (-t and -O) are applied to the table of
           already mounted filesystems.

           Since version 2.35 it is possible to use the command line option -o
           to alter mount options from fstab (see also --options-mode).

           Note that it is a bad practice to use mount -a for fstab checking.
           The recommended solution is findmnt --verify.

       -B, --bind
           Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are
           available in both places). See above, under Bind mounts.

       -c, --no-canonicalize
           Don't canonicalize paths. The mount command canonicalizes all paths
           (from the command line or fstab) by default. This option can be
           used together with the -f flag for already canonicalized absolute
           paths. The option is designed for mount helpers which call mount
           -i. It is strongly recommended to not use this command-line option
           for normal mount operations.

           Note that mount does not pass this option to the /sbin/mount.type
           helpers.

       -F, --fork
           (Used in conjunction with -a.) Fork off a new incarnation of mount
           for each device. This will do the mounts on different devices or
           different NFS servers in parallel. This has the advantage that it
           is faster; also NFS timeouts proceed in parallel. A disadvantage is
           that the order of the mount operations is undefined. Thus, you
           cannot use this option if you want to mount both /usr and
           /usr/spool.

       -f, --fake
           Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if
           it's not obvious, this "fakes" mounting the filesystem. This option
           is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to determine what the
           mount command is trying to do. It can also be used to add entries
           for devices that were mounted earlier with the -n option. The -f
           option checks for an existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when
           the record already exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this
           check is done by the kernel).

       -i, --internal-only
           Don't call the /sbin/mount.filesystem helper even if it exists.

       -L, --label label
           Mount the partition that has the specified label.

       -l, --show-labels
           Add the labels in the mount output. mount must have permission to
           read the disk device (e.g. be set-user-ID root) for this to work.
           One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using the
           e2label(8) utility, or for XFS using xfs_admin(8), or for reiserfs
           using reiserfstune(8).

       -M, --move
           Move a subtree to some other place. See above, the subsection The
           move operation.

       -m, --mkdir[=mode]
           Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not exist
           yet. Alias to "-o X-mount.mkdir[=mode]", the default mode is 0755.
           For more details see X-mount.mkdir below.

       -n, --no-mtab
           Mount without writing in /etc/mtab. This is necessary for example
           when /etc is on a read-only filesystem.

       -N, --namespace ns
           Perform the mount operation in the mount namespace specified by ns.
           ns is either PID of process running in that namespace or special
           file representing that namespace.

           mount switches to the mount namespace when it reads /etc/fstab,
           writes /etc/mtab: (or writes to _/run/mount) and calls mount(2),
           otherwise it runs in the original mount namespace. This means that
           the target namespace does not have to contain any libraries or
           other requirements necessary to execute the mount(2) call.

           See mount_namespaces(7) for more information.

       -O, --test-opts opts
           Limit the set of filesystems to which the -a option applies. In
           this regard it is like the -t option except that -O is useless
           without -a. For example, the command

           mount -a -O no_netdev

           mounts all filesystems except those which have the option netdev
           specified in the options field in the /etc/fstab file.

           It is different from -t in that each option is matched exactly; a
           leading no at the beginning of one option does not negate the rest.

           The -t and -O options are cumulative in effect; that is, the
           command

           mount -a -t ext2 -O  _netdev

           mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all
           filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option
           specified.

       -o, --options opts
           Use the specified mount options. The opts argument is a
           comma-separated list. For example:

           mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nodev,nosuid

           For more details, see the FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS and
           FILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS sections.

       --options-mode mode
           Controls how to combine options from fstab/mtab with options from
           the command line. mode can be one of ignore, append, prepend or
           replace. For example, append means that options from fstab are
           appended to options from the command line. The default value is
           prepend -- it means command line options are evaluated after fstab
           options. Note that the last option wins if there are conflicting
           ones.

       --options-source source
           Source of default options. source is a comma-separated list of
           fstab, mtab and disable. disable disables fstab and mtab and
           enables --options-source-force. The default value is fstab,mtab.

       --options-source-force
           Use options from fstab/mtab even if both device and dir are
           specified.

       -R, --rbind
           Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else (so
           that its contents are available in both places). See above, the
           subsection Bind mounts.

       -r, --read-only
           Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is -o ro.

           Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel
           behavior, the system may still write to the device. For example,
           ext3 and ext4 will replay the journal if the filesystem is dirty.
           To prevent this kind of write access, you may want to mount an ext3
           or ext4 filesystem with the ro,noload mount options or set the
           block device itself to read-only mode, see the blockdev(8) command.

       -s
           Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will ignore
           mount options not supported by a filesystem type. Not all
           filesystems support this option. Currently it's supported by the
           mount.nfs mount helper only.

       --source device
           If only one argument for the mount command is given, then the
           argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or source
           (device). This option allows you to explicitly define that the
           argument is the mount source.

       --target directory
           If only one argument for the mount command is given, then the
           argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or source
           (device). This option allows you to explicitly define that the
           argument is the mount target.

       --target-prefix directory
           Prepend the specified directory to all mount targets. This option
           can be used to follow fstab, but mount operations are done in
           another place, for example:

           mount --all --target-prefix /chroot -o X-mount.mkdir

           mounts all from system fstab to /chroot, all missing mountpoint are
           created (due to X-mount.mkdir). See also --fstab to use an
           alternative fstab.

       -T, --fstab path
           Specifies an alternative fstab file. If path is a directory, then
           the files in the directory are sorted by strverscmp(3); files that
           start with "." or without an .fstab extension are ignored. The
           option can be specified more than once. This option is mostly
           designed for initramfs or chroot scripts where additional
           configuration is specified beyond standard system configuration.

           Note that mount does not pass the option --fstab to the
           /sbin/mount.type helpers, meaning that the alternative fstab files
           will be invisible for the helpers. This is no problem for normal
           mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always require fstab to verify
           the user's rights.

       -t, --types fstype
           The argument following the -t is used to indicate the filesystem
           type. The filesystem types which are currently supported depend on
           the running kernel. See /proc/filesystems and /lib/modules/$(uname
           -r)/kernel/fs for a complete list of the filesystems. The most
           common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and
           cifs.

           The programs mount and umount(8) support filesystem subtypes. The
           subtype is defined by a '.subtype' suffix. For example
           'fuse.sshfs'. It's recommended to use subtype notation rather than
           add any prefix to the mount source (for example 'sshfs#example.com'
           is deprecated).

           If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is specified, mount
           will try to guess the desired type. mount uses the libblkid(3)
           library for guessing the filesystem type; if that does not turn up
           anything that looks familiar, mount will try to read the file
           /etc/filesystems, or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
           All of the filesystem types listed there will be tried, except for
           those that are labeled "nodev" (e.g. devpts, proc and nfs). If
           /etc/filesystems ends in a line with a single *, mount will read
           /proc/filesystems afterwards. While trying, all filesystem types
           will be mounted with the mount option silent.

           The auto type may be useful for user-mounted floppies. Creating a
           file /etc/filesystems can be useful to change the probe order
           (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before ext2) or if you use
           a kernel module autoloader.

           More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list, for
           the -t option as well as in an /etc/fstab entry. The list of
           filesystem types for the -t option can be prefixed with no to
           specify the filesystem types on which no action should be taken.
           The prefix no has no effect when specified in an /etc/fstab entry.

           The prefix no can be meaningful with the -a option. For example,
           the command

           mount -a -t nomsdos,smbfs

           mounts all filesystems except those of type msdos and smbfs.

           For most types all the mount program has to do is issue a simple
           mount(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem
           type is required. For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs,
           smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs,
           smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount program. In
           order to make it possible to treat all types in a uniform way,
           mount will execute the program /sbin/mount.type (if that exists)
           when called with type type. Since different versions of the
           smbmount program have different calling conventions,
           /sbin/mount.smbfs may have to be a shell script that sets up the
           desired call.

       -U, --uuid uuid
           Mount the partition that has the specified uuid.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose mode.

       -w, --rw, --read-write
           Mount the filesystem read/write. Read-write is the kernel default
           and the mount default is to try read-only if the previous mount(2)
           syscall with read-write flags on write-protected devices failed.

           A synonym is -o rw.

           Note that specifying -w on the command line forces mount to never
           try read-only mount on write-protected devices or already mounted
           read-only filesystems.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: lscpu

DESCRIPTION: lscpu - display information about the CPU architecture

USAGE: lscpu [options]

OPTIONS:
-a, --all
           Include lines for online and offline CPUs in the output (default
           for -e). This option may only be specified together with option -e
           or -p.

       -B, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit
           prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are
           exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability, by
           exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1
           MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting
           on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.

       -b, --online
           Limit the output to online CPUs (default for -p). This option may
           only be specified together with option -e or -p.

       -C, --caches[=list]
           Display details about CPU caches. For details about available
           information see --help output.

           If the list argument is omitted, all columns for which data is
           available are included in the command output.

           When specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal sign
           (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
           Examples: -C=NAME,ONE-SIZE or --caches=NAME,ONE-SIZE.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lscpu -C=+ALLOC-POLICY).

       -c, --offline
           Limit the output to offline CPUs. This option may only be specified
           together with option -e or -p.

       -e, --extended[=list]
           Display the CPU information in human-readable format.

           If the list argument is omitted, the default columns are included
           in the command output. The default output is subject to change.

           When specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal sign
           (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
           Examples: '-e=cpu,node' or '--extended=cpu,node'.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lscpu -e=+MHZ).

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format for the default summary or extended output
           (see --extended).

       -p, --parse[=list]
           Optimize the command output for easy parsing.

           If the list argument is omitted, the command output is compatible
           with earlier versions of lscpu. In this compatible format, two
           commas are used to separate CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches are
           identified the cache column is omitted. If the list argument is
           used, cache columns are separated with a colon (:).

           When specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal sign
           (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
           Examples: '-p=cpu,node' or '--parse=cpu,node'.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lscpu -p=+MHZ).

       -s, --sysroot directory
           Gather CPU data for a Linux instance other than the instance from
           which the lscpu command is issued. The specified directory is the
           system root of the Linux instance to be inspected.

       -x, --hex
           Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (for example "ff"). The default
           is to print the sets in list format (for example 0,1). Note that
           before version 2.30 the mask has been printed with 0x prefix.

       -y, --physical
           Display physical IDs for all columns with topology elements (core,
           socket, etc.). Other than logical IDs, which are assigned by lscpu,
           physical IDs are platform-specific values that are provided by the
           kernel. Physical IDs are not necessarily unique and they might not
           be arranged sequentially. If the kernel could not retrieve a
           physical ID for an element lscpu prints the dash (-) character.

           The CPU logical numbers are not affected by this option.

       --output-all
           Output all available columns. This option must be combined with
           either --extended, --parse or --caches.

       --tera Display the amount of memory in terabytes. Implies --si.

       --peta Display the amount of memory in petabytes. Implies --si.

       -h, --human
              Show  all  output  fields automatically scaled to shortest three
              digit unit and display the units of print out.  Following  units
              are used.

                B = bytes
                Ki = kibibyte
                Mi = mebibyte
                Gi = gibibyte
                Ti = tebibyte
                Pi = pebibyte

              If  unit  is  missing, and you have exbibyte of RAM or swap, the

              header.

       -w, --wide
              Switch  to  the  wide  mode. The wide mode produces lines longer
              than 80 characters. In this mode buffers and cache are  reported
              in two separate columns.

       -c, --count count

       -v, --committed
              Display  a  line  showing  the memory commit limit and amount of
              committed/uncommitted memory. The total column on this line will
              display the memory commit limit.   This line is relevant if mem-
              ory overcommit is disabled.

       --help Print help.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

COMMAND: vmstat

DESCRIPTION: vmstat - Report virtual memory statistics

USAGE: vmstat [options] [delay [count]]

OPTIONS:
delay  The delay between updates in seconds.  If no delay is specified,
              only one report is printed with the average values since boot.

       count  Number  of updates.  In absence of count, when delay is defined,
              default is infinite.

       -a, --active
              Display active and  inactive memory, given a  2.5.41  kernel  or
              better.

       -f, --forks
              The -f switch displays the number of forks since boot.  This in-
              cludes the fork, vfork, and clone system calls, and  is  equiva-
              lent to the total number of tasks created.  Each process is rep-
              resented by one or more tasks, depending on thread usage.   This
              display does not repeat.

       -m, --slabs
              Displays slabinfo.

       -n, --one-header
              Display the header only once rather than periodically.

       -s, --stats
              Displays  a  table  of various event counters and memory statis-
              tics.  This display does not repeat.

       -d, --disk
              Report disk statistics (2.5.70 or above required).

       -D, --disk-sum
              Report some summary statistics about disk activity.

       -p, --partition device
              Detailed statistics about partition (2.5.70 or above required).

       -S, --unit character
              Switches outputs between 1000 (k), 1024  (K),  1000000  (m),  or
              1048576  (M)  bytes.  Note this does not change the swap (si/so)
              or block (bi/bo) fields.

       -t, --timestamp
              Append timestamp to each line

       -w, --wide
              Wide output mode (useful for systems with higher amount of  mem-
              ory,  where the default output mode suffers from unwanted column
              breakage).  The output is wider than 80 characters per line.

       -y, --no-first
              Omits first report with statistics since system boot.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

COMMAND: dmidecode

DESCRIPTION: dmidecode - DMI table decoder

USAGE: dmidecode [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
-d, --dev-mem FILE
              Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem)

       -q, --quiet
              Be less verbose. Unknown, inactive and OEM-specific entries  are
              not displayed. Meta-data and handle references are hidden.

       -s, --string KEYWORD
              Only  display the value of the DMI string identified by KEYWORD.
              It must be a  keyword  from  the  following  list:  bios-vendor,
              bios-version,          bios-release-date,         bios-revision,
              firmware-revision,   system-manufacturer,   system-product-name,
              system-version,        system-serial-number,        system-uuid,
              system-sku-number,    system-family,     baseboard-manufacturer,
              baseboard-product-name,                       baseboard-version,
              baseboard-serial-number,                    baseboard-asset-tag,
              chassis-manufacturer,       chassis-type,       chassis-version,
              chassis-serial-number,   chassis-asset-tag,    processor-family,
              processor-manufacturer,  processor-version, processor-frequency.
              Each keyword corresponds to a given DMI type and a given  offset
              within  this  entry  type.  Not all strings may be meaningful or
              even defined on all systems. Some keywords may return more  than
              one  result on some systems (e.g.  processor-version on a multi-
              processor system).  If KEYWORD is not provided or not  valid,  a
              list  of  all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode exits with
              an error.  This option cannot be used more than once.

              Note: on Linux, most of these strings can alternatively be  read
              directly   from  sysfs,  typically  from  files  under  /sys/de-
              vices/virtual/dmi/id.  Most of these files are even readable  by
              regular users.

       -t, --type TYPE
              Only  display  the  entries of type TYPE. It can be either a DMI
              type number, or a comma-separated list of  type  numbers,  or  a
              keyword  from  the  following  list:  bios,  system,  baseboard,
              chassis, processor, memory, cache, connector,  slot.   Refer  to
              the DMI TYPES section below for details.  If this option is used
              more than once, the set of displayed entries will be  the  union
              of all the given types.  If TYPE is not provided or not valid, a
              list of all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode  exits  with
              an error.

       -H, --handle HANDLE
              Only display the entry whose handle matches HANDLE.  HANDLE is a
              16-bit integer.

       -u, --dump
              Do not decode the entries, dump their  contents  as  hexadecimal
              instead.   Note that this is still a text output, no binary data
              will be thrown upon you. The strings attached to each entry  are
              displayed  as  both hexadecimal and ASCII. This option is mainly
              useful for debugging.

           --dump-bin FILE
              Do not decode the entries, instead dump the DMI data to  a  file
              in  binary  form.  The  generated  file  is  suitable to pass to
              --from-dump later.

           --from-dump FILE
              Read the DMI data from a binary file previously generated  using
              --dump-bin.

           --no-sysfs
              Do not attempt to read DMI data from sysfs files. This is mainly
              useful for debugging.

           --oem-string N
              Only display the value of the OEM string number N. The first OEM
              string has number 1. With special value count, return the number
              of OEM strings instead.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit

       Options --string, --type, --dump-bin  and  --oem-string  determine  the
       output format and are mutually exclusive.

       Please  note  in  case  of  dmidecode is run on a system with BIOS that
       boasts new SMBIOS specification, which is not  supported  by  the  tool
       yet,  it  will print out relevant message in addition to requested data
       on the very top of the output. Thus informs the output data is not  re-
       liable.

COMMAND: lspci

DESCRIPTION: lspci - list all PCI devices

USAGE: lspci [options]

OPTIONS:
Basic display modes
       -m     Dump  PCI  device data in a backward-compatible machine readable
              form.  See below for details.

       -mm    Dump PCI device data in a machine readable form for easy parsing
              by scripts.  See below for details.

       -t     Show  a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges, devices
              and connections between them.

   Display options
       -v     Be verbose and display detailed information about all devices.

       -vv    Be very verbose and display more details.  This  level  includes
              everything deemed useful.

       -vvv   Be  even  more  verbose  and  display  everything we are able to
              parse, even if it doesn't look interesting at all  (e.g.,  unde-
              fined memory regions).

       -k     Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel modules
              capable of handling it.  Turned on by default when -v  is  given
              in  the  normal  mode of output.  (Currently works only on Linux
              with kernel 2.6 or newer.)

       -x     Show hexadecimal dump of the standard part of the  configuration
              space (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for CardBus bridges).

       -xxx   Show  hexadecimal  dump of the whole PCI configuration space. It
              is available only to root as several PCI devices crash when  you
              try to read some parts of the config space (this behavior proba-
              bly doesn't violate the PCI standard, but  it's  at  least  very
              stupid).  However,  such  devices are rare, so you needn't worry
              much.

       -xxxx  Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte) PCI configura-
              tion space available on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.

       -b     Bus-centric  view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by
              the cards on the PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.

       -D     Always show PCI domain numbers.  By  default,  lspci  suppresses
              them on machines which have only domain 0.

       -P     Identify  PCI devices by path through each bridge, instead of by
              bus number.

       -PP    Identify PCI devices by path through each  bridge,  showing  the
              bus number as well as the device number.

   Options to control resolving ID's to names
       -n     Show  PCI  vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking
              them up in the PCI ID list.

       -nn    Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.

       -q     Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a device is  not
              found  in the local pci.ids file. If the DNS query succeeds, the
              result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it is recognized in sub-
              sequent  runs  even if -q is not given any more. Please use this
              switch inside automated scripts only with caution to avoid over-
              loading the database servers.

       -qq    Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.

       -Q     Query the central database even for entries which are recognized
              locally.  Use this if you suspect that the  displayed  entry  is
              wrong.

   Options for selection of devices
       -s [[[[<domain>]:]<bus>]:][<device>][.[<func>]]
              Show  only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine
              has several host bridges, they can either  share  a  common  bus
              number  space  or  each  of them can address a PCI domain of its
              own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), device
              (0  to  1f) and function (0 to 7).  Each component of the device
              address can be omitted or set to "*", both meaning "any  value".
              All  numbers  are  hexadecimal.  E.g., "0:" means all devices on
              bus 0, "0" means all functions of device 0 on any bus, "0.3" se-
              lects  third  function  of  device 0 on all buses and ".4" shows
              only the fourth function of each device.

       -d [<vendor>]:[<device>][:<class>[:<prog-if>]]
              Show only devices with specified vendor, device, class  ID,  and
              programming  interface.   The  ID's are given in hexadecimal and
              may be omitted or given as "*", both meaning  "any  value".  The
              class ID can contain "x" characters which stand for "any digit".

   Other options
       -i <file>
              Use    <file>    as    the    PCI    ID    list    instead    of
              /usr/share/misc/pci.ids.

       -p <file>
              Use <file> as the map of PCI ID's handled by kernel modules.  By
              default,  lspci uses /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap.
              Applies only to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.

       -M     Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough  scan  of  all
              PCI  devices, including those behind misconfigured bridges, etc.
              This option gives meaningful results only with a direct hardware
              access  mode,  which  usually  requires root privileges.  By de-
              fault, the bus mapper scans domain. You can use the -s option to
              select a different domain.

       --version
              Shows lspci version. This option should be used stand-alone.

   PCI access options
       The  PCI  utilities  use  the  PCI  library to talk to PCI devices (see
       pcilib(7) for details). You can use the following options to  influence
       its behavior:

       -A <method>
              The  library  supports  a  variety  of methods to access the PCI
              hardware.  By default, it uses the first  access  method  avail-
              able, but you can use this option to override this decision. See
              -A help for a list of available methods and their descriptions.

       -O <param>=<value>
              The behavior of the library is controlled by several  named  pa-
              rameters.  This option allows one to set the value of any of the
              parameters. Use -O help for a list of known parameters and their
              default values.

       -H1    Use  direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1.
              (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)

       -H2    Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism  2.
              (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)

       -F <file>
              Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of devices and
              values of their configuration registers from the given file pro-
              duced  by  an  earlier run of lspci -x.  This is very useful for
              analysis of user-supplied bug reports, because you  can  display
              the  hardware configuration in any way you want without disturb-
              ing the user with requests for more dumps.

       -G     Increase debug level of the library.

              when  available,  for  USB  device classes including hub, audio,
              HID, communications, and chipcard. Can be used with  the  t  op-
              tion.

       -s [[bus]:][devnum]
              Show  only devices in specified bus and/or devnum.  Both IDs are
              given in decimal and may be omitted.

       -d [vendor]:[product]
              Show only devices with the  specified  vendor  and  product  ID.
              Both IDs are given in hexadecimal.

       -D device
              Do not scan the /dev/bus/usb directory, instead display only in-
              formation about the device whose device file is given.  The  de-
              vice  file  should be something like /dev/bus/usb/001/001.  This
              option displays detailed information like the v option; you must
              be root to do this.

       -t, --tree
              Tells lsusb to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree.
              Verbosity can be increased twice with the v option.

       -V, --version
              Print version information on standard output, then exit success-
              fully.

COMMAND: lsblk

DESCRIPTION: lsblk - list block devices

USAGE: lsblk [options] [device...]

OPTIONS:
-A, --noempty
           Don't print empty devices.

       -a, --all
           Disable all built-in filters and list all empty devices and RAM
           disk devices too.

       -b, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit
           prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are
           exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability, by
           exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1
           MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting
           on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.

       -D, --discard
           Print information about the discarding capabilities (TRIM, UNMAP)
           for each device.

       -d, --nodeps
           Do not print holder devices or slaves. For example, lsblk --nodeps
           /dev/sda prints information about the sda device only.

       -E, --dedup column
           Use column as a de-duplication key to de-duplicate output tree. If
           the key is not available for the device, or the device is a
           partition and parental whole-disk device provides the same key than
           the device is always printed.

           The usual use case is to de-duplicate output on system multi-path
           devices, for example by -E WWN.

       -e, --exclude list
           Exclude the devices specified by the comma-separated list of major
           device numbers. Note that RAM disks (major=1) are excluded by
           default if --all is not specified. The filter is applied to the
           top-level devices only. This may be confusing for --list output
           format where hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.

       -f, --fs
           Output info about filesystems. This option is equivalent to -o
           NAME,FSTYPE,FSVER,LABEL,UUID,FSAVAIL,FSUSE%,MOUNTPOINTS. The
           authoritative information about filesystems and raids is provided
           by the blkid(8) command.

       -I, --include list
           Include devices specified by the comma-separated list of major
           device numbers. The filter is applied to the top-level devices
           only. This may be confusing for --list output format where
           hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.

       -i, --ascii
           Use ASCII characters for tree formatting.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. It's strongly recommended to use --output
           and also --tree if necessary.

       -l, --list
           Produce output in the form of a list. The output does not provide
           information about relationships between devices and since version
           2.34 every device is printed only once if --pairs or --raw not
           specified (the parsable outputs are maintained in backwardly
           compatible way).

       -M, --merge
           Group parents of sub-trees to provide more readable output for
           RAIDs and Multi-path devices. The tree-like output is required.

       -m, --perms
           Output info about device owner, group and mode. This option is
           equivalent to -o NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE.

       -n, --noheadings
           Do not print a header line.

       -o, --output list
           Specify which output columns to print. Use --help to get a list of
           all supported columns. The columns may affect tree-like output. The
           default is to use tree for the column 'NAME' (see also --tree).

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lsblk -o +UUID).

       -O, --output-all
           Output all available columns.

       -P, --pairs
           Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. The output lines
           are still ordered by dependencies. All potentially unsafe value
           characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>). See also option --shell.

       -p, --paths
           Print full device paths.

       -r, --raw
           Produce output in raw format. The output lines are still ordered by
           dependencies. All potentially unsafe characters are hex-escaped
           (\x<code>) in the NAME, KNAME, LABEL, PARTLABEL and MOUNTPOINT
           columns.

       -S, --scsi
           Output info about SCSI devices only. All partitions, slaves and
           holder devices are ignored.

       -s, --inverse
           Print dependencies in inverse order. If the --list output is
           requested then the lines are still ordered by dependencies.

       -T, --tree[=column]
           Force tree-like output format. If column is specified, then a tree
           is printed in the column. The default is NAME column.

       -t, --topology
           Output info about block-device topology. This option is equivalent
           to

           -o
           NAME,ALIGNMENT,MIN-IO,OPT-IO,PHY-SEC,LOG-SEC,ROTA,SCHED,RQ-SIZE,RA,WSAME.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

       -w, --width number
           Specifies output width as a number of characters. The default is
           the number of the terminal columns, and if not executed on a
           terminal, then output width is not restricted at all by default.
           This option also forces lsblk to assume that terminal control
           characters and unsafe characters are not allowed. The expected
           use-case is for example when lsblk is used by the watch(1) command.

       -x, --sort column
           Sort output lines by column. This option enables --list output
           format by default. It is possible to use the option --tree to force
           tree-like output and than the tree branches are sorted by the
           column.

       -y, --shell
           The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed
           for shell variable identifiers, for example, MIN_IO and FSUSE_PCT
           instead of MIN-IO and FSUSE%. This is usable, for example, with
           --pairs. Note that this feature has been automatically enabled for
           --pairs in version 2.37, but due to compatibility issues, now it's
           necessary to request this behavior by --shell.

       -z, --zoned
           Print the zone related information for each device.

       --sysroot directory
           Gather data for a Linux instance other than the instance from which
           the lsblk command is issued. The specified directory is the system
           root of the Linux instance to be inspected. The real device nodes
           in the target directory can be replaced by text files with udev
           attributes.

COMMAND: fdisk

DESCRIPTION: fdisk - manipulate disk partition table

USAGE: fdisk [options] device

       fdisk -l [device...]

OPTIONS:
-b, --sector-size sectorsize
           Specify the sector size of the disk. Valid values are 512, 1024,
           2048, and 4096. (Recent kernels know the sector size. Use this
           option only on old kernels or to override the kernel's ideas.)
           Since util-linux-2.17, fdisk differentiates between logical and
           physical sector size. This option changes both sector sizes to
           sectorsize.

       -B, --protect-boot
           Don't erase the beginning of the first disk sector when creating a
           new disk label. This feature is supported for GPT and MBR.

       -c, --compatibility[=mode]
           Specify the compatibility mode, 'dos' or 'nondos'. The default is
           non-DOS mode. For backward compatibility, it is possible to use the
           option without the mode argument -- then the default is used. Note
           that the optional mode argument cannot be separated from the -c
           option by a space, the correct form is for example -c=dos.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section.

       -l, --list
           List the partition tables for the specified devices and then exit.

           If no devices are given, the devices mentioned in /proc/partitions
           (if this file exists) are used. Devices are always listed in the
           order in which they are specified on the command-line, or by the
           kernel listed in /proc/partitions.

       -x, --list-details
           Like --list, but provides more details.

       --lock[=mode]
           Use exclusive BSD lock for device or file it operates. The optional
           argument mode can be yes, no (or 1 and 0) or nonblock. If the mode
           argument is omitted, it defaults to yes. This option overwrites
           environment variable $LOCK_BLOCK_DEVICE. The default is not to use
           any lock at all, but it's recommended to avoid collisions with
           systemd-udevd(8) or other tools.

       -n, --noauto-pt
           Don't automatically create a default partition table on empty
           device. The partition table has to be explicitly created by user
           (by command like 'o', 'g', etc.).

       -o, --output list
           Specify which output columns to print. Use --help to get a list of
           all supported columns.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., -o +UUID).

       -s, --getsz
           Print the size in 512-byte sectors of each given block device. This
           option is DEPRECATED in favour of blockdev(8).

       -t, --type type
           Enable support only for disklabels of the specified type, and
           disable support for all other types.

       -u, --units[=unit]
           When listing partition tables, show sizes in 'sectors' or in
           'cylinders'. The default is to show sizes in sectors. For backward
           compatibility, it is possible to use the option without the unit
           argument -- then the default is used. Note that the optional unit
           argument cannot be separated from the -u option by a space, the
           correct form is for example '-u=cylinders'.

       -C, --cylinders number
           Specify the number of cylinders of the disk. I have no idea why
           anybody would want to do so.

       -H, --heads number
           Specify the number of heads of the disk. (Not the physical number,
           of course, but the number used for partition tables.) Reasonable
           values are 255 and 16.

       -S, --sectors number
           Specify the number of sectors per track of the disk. (Not the
           physical number, of course, but the number used for partition
           tables.) A reasonable value is 63.

       -w, --wipe when
           Wipe filesystem, RAID and partition-table signatures from the
           device, in order to avoid possible collisions. The argument when
           can be auto, never or always. When this option is not given, the
           default is auto, in which case signatures are wiped only when in
           interactive mode. In all cases detected signatures are reported by
           warning messages before a new partition table is created. See also
           wipefs(8) command.

       -W, --wipe-partitions when
           Wipe filesystem, RAID and partition-table signatures from a newly
           created partitions, in order to avoid possible collisions. The
           argument when can be auto, never or always. When this option is not
           given, the default is auto, in which case signatures are wiped only
           when in interactive mode and after confirmation by user. In all
           cases detected signatures are reported by warning messages before a
           new partition is created. See also wipefs(8) command.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

DESCRIPTION: grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

USAGE: grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

OPTIONS:
Generic Program Information
       --help Output a usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Output the version number of grep and exit.

   Pattern Syntax
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERNS  as  extended regular expressions (EREs, see
              below).

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular expressions.

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS  as  basic  regular  expressions  (BREs,  see
              below).  This is the default.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret   PATTERNS   as  Perl-compatible  regular  expressions
              (PCREs).  This option is experimental when combined with the  -z
              (--null-data)  option,  and  grep  -P  may warn of unimplemented
              features.

   Matching Control
       -e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS
              Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option is  used  multiple
              times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search for all
              patterns given.  This option can be used to  protect  a  pattern
              beginning with "-".

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used
              multiple times or is combined with  the  -e  (--regexp)  option,
              search  for  all  patterns  given.  The empty file contains zero
              patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and  input  data,  so  that
              characters that differ only in case match each other.

       --no-ignore-case
              Do  not  ignore  case  distinctions  in patterns and input data.
              This is the default.  This option is useful for passing to shell
              scripts  that  already use -i, to cancel its effects because the
              two options override each other.

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       -w, --word-regexp
              Select only those  lines  containing  matches  that  form  whole
              words.   The  test is that the matching substring must either be
              at the  beginning  of  the  line,  or  preceded  by  a  non-word
              constituent  character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end
              of the line or followed by  a  non-word  constituent  character.
              Word-constituent   characters   are  letters,  digits,  and  the
              underscore.  This option has no effect if -x is also specified.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly  match  the  whole  line.
              For  a  regular  expression pattern, this is like parenthesizing
              the pattern and then surrounding it with ^ and $.

   General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching  lines
              for  each  input  file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see
              above), count non-matching lines.

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Surround  the  matched  (non-empty)  strings,  matching   lines,
              context  lines,  file  names,  line  numbers,  byte offsets, and
              separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with  escape
              sequences  to display them in color on the terminal.  The colors
              are defined by the environment variable  GREP_COLORS.   WHEN  is
              never, always, or auto.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Suppress  normal  output;  instead  print the name of each input
              file from which no output would normally have been printed.

       -l, --files-with-matches
              Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input
              file  from  which  output  would  normally  have  been  printed.
              Scanning each input file stops upon first match.

       -m NUM, --max-count=NUM
              Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If NUM  is  zero,
              grep  stops  right  away  without reading input.  A NUM of -1 is
              treated as infinity and grep does not stop; this is the default.
              If  the  input  is  standard  input from a regular file, and NUM
              matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard  input
              is  positioned  to  just  after  the  last  matching line before
              exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing  context  lines.
              This  enables  a  calling process to resume a search.  When grep
              stops after NUM matching lines, it outputs any trailing  context
              lines.   When  the  -c or --count option is also used, grep does
              not  output  a  count  greater  than  NUM.   When  the   -v   or
              --invert-match  option is also used, grep stops after outputting
              NUM non-matching lines.

       -o, --only-matching
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts  of  a  matching  line,
              with each such part on a separate output line.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Quiet;   do   not  write  anything  to  standard  output.   Exit
              immediately with zero status if any match is found, even  if  an
              error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.

       -s, --no-messages
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.

   Output Line Prefix Control
       -b, --byte-offset
              Print  the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each
              line of output.  If -o (--only-matching) is specified, print the
              offset of the matching part itself.

       -H, --with-filename
              Print  the  file  name for each match.  This is the default when
              there is more than one file to search.  This is a GNU extension.

       -h, --no-filename
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on  output.   This  is  the
              default  when there is only one file (or only standard input) to
              search.

       --label=LABEL
              Display input actually  coming  from  standard  input  as  input
              coming  from  file  LABEL.  This can be useful for commands that
              transform a file's contents before  searching,  e.g.,  gzip  -cd
              foo.gz  |  grep  --label=foo -H 'some pattern'.  See also the -H
              option.

       -n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line  number  within
              its input file.

       -T, --initial-tab
              Make  sure  that the first character of actual line content lies
              on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks normal.  This
              is  useful  with  options that prefix their output to the actual
              content: -H,-n, and -b.  In order  to  improve  the  probability
              that lines from a single file will all start at the same column,
              this also causes the line number and byte offset (if present) to
              be printed in a minimum size field width.

       -Z, --null
              Output  a  zero  byte  (the  ASCII NUL character) instead of the
              character that normally follows a file name.  For example,  grep
              -lZ  outputs  a  zero  byte  after each file name instead of the
              usual newline.  This option makes the output  unambiguous,  even
              in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like
              newlines.  This option can  be  used  with  commands  like  find
              -print0,  perl  -0,  sort  -z, and xargs -0 to process arbitrary
              file names, even those that contain newline characters.

   Context Line Control
       -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
              Print NUM  lines  of  trailing  context  after  matching  lines.
              Places   a  line  containing  a  group  separator  (--)  between
              contiguous groups of matches.  With the  -o  or  --only-matching
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
              Print  NUM  lines  of  leading  context  before  matching lines.
              Places  a  line  containing  a  group  separator  (--)   between
              contiguous  groups  of  matches.  With the -o or --only-matching
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of output context.  Places a line  containing  a
              group separator (--) between contiguous groups of matches.  With
              the -o or --only-matching option,  this  has  no  effect  and  a
              warning is given.

       --group-separator=SEP
              When  -A,  -B, or -C are in use, print SEP instead of -- between
              groups of lines.

       --no-group-separator
              When -A, -B, or -C are in use, do not print a separator  between
              groups of lines.

   File and Directory Selection
       -a, --text
              Process  a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to
              the --binary-files=text option.

       --binary-files=TYPE
              If a file's data or metadata indicate  that  the  file  contains
              binary  data,  assume  that  the file is of type TYPE.  Non-text
              bytes indicate binary data; these are either output  bytes  that
              are  improperly  encoded  for  the current locale, or null input
              bytes when the -z option is not given.

              By default, TYPE is binary, and  grep  suppresses  output  after
              null  input  binary  data  is  discovered, and suppresses output
              lines that contain improperly encoded data.  When some output is
              suppressed,  grep  follows any output with a message to standard
              error saying that a binary file matches.

              If TYPE is without-match, when grep discovers null input  binary
              data  it  assumes that the rest of the file does not match; this
              is equivalent to the -I option.

              If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary  file  as  if  it  were
              text; this is equivalent to the -a option.

              When  type  is  binary,  grep  may  treat non-text bytes as line
              terminators even without the -z  option.   This  means  choosing
              binary  versus text can affect whether a pattern matches a file.
              For example, when type is binary the pattern q$  might  match  q
              immediately  followed  by  a  null byte, even though this is not
              matched when type is text.  Conversely, when type is binary  the
              pattern . (period) might not match a null byte.

              Warning:  The  -a  option might output binary garbage, which can
              have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and  if  the
              terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.  On the other
              hand, when reading files whose text encodings  are  unknown,  it
              can   be  helpful  to  use  -a  or  to  set  LC_ALL='C'  in  the
              environment, in order to find more matches even if  the  matches
              are unsafe for direct display.

       -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION
              If  an  input  file  is  a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to
              process it.  By  default,  ACTION  is  read,  which  means  that
              devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION
              is skip, devices are silently skipped.

       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
              If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process  it.   By
              default,  ACTION is read, i.e., read directories just as if they
              were  ordinary  files.   If  ACTION  is  skip,   silently   skip
              directories.   If  ACTION  is recurse, read all files under each
              directory, recursively, following symbolic links  only  if  they
              are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the -r option.

       --exclude=GLOB
              Skip  any  command-line file with a name suffix that matches the
              pattern GLOB, using wildcard matching; a name suffix  is  either
              the  whole name, or a trailing part that starts with a non-slash
              character immediately after a  slash  (/)  in  the  name.   When
              searching  recursively, skip any subfile whose base name matches
              GLOB; the base name is the part after the last slash.  A pattern
              can  use *, ?, and [...] as wildcards, and \ to quote a wildcard
              or backslash character literally.

       --exclude-from=FILE
              Skip files whose base name matches any of  the  file-name  globs
              read  from  FILE  (using  wildcard  matching  as described under
              --exclude).

       --exclude-dir=GLOB
              Skip any command-line directory with a name suffix that  matches
              the   pattern   GLOB.   When  searching  recursively,  skip  any
              subdirectory whose base name matches GLOB.  Ignore any redundant
              trailing slashes in GLOB.

       -I     Process  a  binary  file as if it did not contain matching data;
              this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.

       --include=GLOB
              Search only files whose base name matches GLOB  (using  wildcard
              matching   as  described  under  --exclude).   If  contradictory
              --include and --exclude options are given, the last matching one
              wins.   If  no  --include  or --exclude options match, a file is
              included unless the first such option is --include.

       -r, --recursive
              Read all files  under  each  directory,  recursively,  following
              symbolic  links only if they are on the command line.  Note that
              if  no  file  operand  is  given,  grep  searches  the   working
              directory.  This is equivalent to the -d recurse option.

       -R, --dereference-recursive
              Read  all  files  under each directory, recursively.  Follow all
              symbolic links, unlike -r.

   Other Options
       --line-buffered
              Use line buffering on output.   This  can  cause  a  performance
              penalty.

       -U, --binary
              Treat  the  file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-
              Windows, grep guesses whether  a  file  is  text  or  binary  as
              described  for  the  --binary-files option.  If grep decides the
              file is a text file,  it  strips  the  CR  characters  from  the
              original file contents (to make regular expressions with ^ and $
              work  correctly).   Specifying  -U  overrules  this   guesswork,
              causing  all  files  to  be  read  and  passed  to  the matching
              mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF  pairs
              at   the  end  of  each  line,  this  will  cause  some  regular
              expressions to fail.  This option has  no  effect  on  platforms
              other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       -z, --null-data
              Treat  input  and  output  data  as  sequences  of  lines,  each
              terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a
              newline.   Like the -Z or --null option, this option can be used
              with commands like sort -z to process arbitrary file names.

COMMAND: smartctl

DESCRIPTION: smartctl - Control and Monitor Utility for SMART Disks

USAGE: smartctl [options] device

OPTIONS:
The options are grouped below into several categories.   smartctl  will
       execute  the  corresponding  commands  in  the  order: INFORMATION, EN-
       ABLE/DISABLE, DISPLAY DATA, RUN/ABORT TESTS.

       SHOW INFORMATION OPTIONS:

       -h, --help, --usage
              Prints a usage message to STDOUT and exits.

       -V, --version, --copyright, --license
              Prints version, copyright, license, home page and  SVN  revision
              information for your copy of smartctl to STDOUT and then exits.

       -i, --info
              Prints the device model number, serial number, firmware version,
              and ATA Standard version/revision information.  Says if the  de-
              vice  supports  SMART,  and if so, whether SMART support is cur-
              rently enabled or disabled.   If  the  device  supports  Logical
              Block  Address mode (LBA mode) print current user drive capacity
              in bytes.  (If drive has a user protected area reserved,  or  is
              "clipped",  this may be smaller than the potential maximum drive
              capacity.)  Indicates if the drive is in the smartmontools data-
              base  (see  '-v'  options below).  If so, the drive model family
              may also be printed.  If '-n'  (see  below)  is  specified,  the
              power mode of the drive is printed.

              [NVMe]  For  NVMe  devices  the information is obtained from the
              Identify Controller and the Identify Namespace data structure.

       --identify[=[w][nvb]]
              [ATA only] Prints an annotated  table  of  the  IDENTIFY  DEVICE
              data.   By  default, only valid words (words not equal to 0x0000
              or 0xffff) and nonzero bits and bit fields  are  printed.   This
              can be changed by the optional argument which consists of one or
              two characters from the set 'wnvb'.  The character  'w'  enables
              printing  of all 256 words.  The character 'n' suppresses print-
              ing of bits, 'v' enables printing of all bits from valid  words,
              'b'  enables  printing  of all bits.  For example '--identify=n'
              (valid words, no bits) produces the shortest output and '--iden-
              tify=wb' (all words, all bits) produces the longest output.

       -a, --all
              Prints  all  SMART  information about the disk.  For ATA devices
              this is equivalent to
              '-H -i -c -A -l error -l selftest -l selective'
              and for SCSI, this is equivalent to
              '-H -i -A -l error -l selftest'.
              For NVMe, this is equivalent to
              '-H -i -c -A -l error'.
              Note that for ATA disks this does not enable the  non-SMART  op-
              tions and the SMART options which require support for 48-bit ATA
              commands.

       -x, --xall
              Prints all SMART and non-SMART  information  about  the  device.
              For ATA devices this is equivalent to
              '-H  -i  -g  all  -g wcreorder -c -A -f brief -l xerror,error -l
              xselftest,selftest -l selective -l directory -l scttemp  -l  sc-
              terc -l devstat -l defects -l sataphy'.
              and for SCSI disks, this is equivalent to
              '-H -i -g all -A -l error -l selftest -l background -l sasphy -l
              defects -l env_rep'.
              and for SCSI zoned disks, add -l zdevstat
              and for SCSI tape drivers and changers, add -l tapedevstat
              For NVMe, this is equivalent to
              '-H -i -c -A -l error'.

       --scan Scans for devices and prints each device name, device  type  and
              protocol  ([ATA]  or  [SCSI])  info.  May be used in conjunction
              with '-d TYPE' to restrict the scan to  a  specific  TYPE.   See
              also info about platform specific device scan and the DEVICESCAN
              directive on smartd(8) man page.

       --scan-open
              Same as --scan, but also tries to open each device before print-
              ing device info.  The device open may change the device type due
              to autodetection (see also '-d test').

              This option can be used to create a draft smartd.conf file.  All
              options  after '--' are appended to each output line.  For exam-
              ple:
              smartctl --scan-open -- -a -W 4,45,50 -m admin@work > smartd.conf

              Multiple '-d TYPE' options may be specified with '--scan[-open]'
              to combine the scan results of more than one TYPE.

       -g NAME, --get=NAME
              Get  non-SMART  device settings.  See '-s, --set' below for fur-
              ther info.

       RUN-TIME BEHAVIOR OPTIONS:

       -j, --json[=cgiosuvy]
              Enables JSON or YAML output mode.

              The output could be modified or enhanced by the  optional  argu-
              ment  which  consists  of  one  or  more characters from the set
              'cgiosuvy':
              'c': Outputs compact format without extra spaces  and  newlines.
              By default, output is pretty-printed.  If used with YAML format,
              the indentation of arrays is reduced.
              'g': Outputs JSON structure as single assignments to  allow  the
              usage  of grep.  Each assignment reflects the absolute path of a
              value.  The syntax is compatible with gron:
              'json.KEY1[INDEX2].KEY3 = VALUE;'.
              'o': Includes the full original plaintext output of smartctl  as
              a JSON array 'smartctl.output[]'.
              's':  Outputs  JSON  object elements sorted by key.  By default,
              object elements are ordered as generated internally.
              'v': Enables verbose output of  possible  unsafe  integers.   If
              specified,  values  which  may exceed JSON safe integer (53-bit)
              range are always output as a number  (with  some  'KEY')  and  a
              string  ('KEY_s'), regardless of the actual value.  Values which
              may exceed 64-bit range are also output as a little endian  byte
              array  ('KEY_le').  By default, the additional elements are only
              output if the value actually exceeds the range.
              'y': [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Outputs in YAML format.

              The following two arguments are primarily indented for  develop-
              ment:
              'i':  Includes  lines from the plaintext output which print info
              already implemented  for  JSON  output.   The  lines  appear  as
              strings with key 'smartctl_NNNN_i'.
              'u':  Includes  lines from the plaintext output which print info
              still unimplemented  for  JSON  output.   The  lines  appear  as
              strings with key 'smartctl_NNNN_u'.

       -q TYPE, --quietmode=TYPE
              Specifies that smartctl should run in one of the quiet modes de-
              scribed here.  The valid arguments to this option are:

              errorsonly - only print: For the '-l error' option, if  nonzero,
              the  number  of  errors  recorded in the SMART error log and the
              power-on time when they occurred; For the '-l selftest'  option,
              errors  recorded  in  the device self-test log; For the '-H' op-
              tion, SMART "disk failing" status  or  device  Attributes  (pre-
              failure  or  usage)  which failed either now or in the past; For
              the '-A' option, device Attributes (pre-failure or usage)  which
              failed either now or in the past.

              silent  - print no output.  The only way to learn about what was
              found is to use the exit status of smartctl (see EXIT STATUS be-
              low).

              noserial - Do not print the serial number of the device.

       -d TYPE, --device=TYPE
              Specifies  the  type of the device.  The valid arguments to this
              option are:

              auto - attempt to guess the device type from the device name  or
              from  controller  type  info provided by the operating system or
              from a matching USB ID entry in the drive database.  This is the
              default.

              test - prints the guessed TYPE, then opens the device and prints
              the (possibly changed) TYPE name and then exits without perform-
              ing any further commands.

              ata - the device type is ATA.  This prevents smartctl from issu-
              ing SCSI commands to an ATA device.

              scsi - the device type is SCSI.  This prevents smartctl from is-
              suing ATA commands to a SCSI device.

              nvme[,NSID]  -  the  device type is NVM Express (NVMe).  The op-
              tional parameter NSID specifies the namespace id (in hex) passed
              to  the  driver.  Use 0xffffffff for the broadcast namespace id.
              The default for NSID is the namespace id addressed by the device
              name.

              sat[,auto][,N]  -  the  device  type  is SCSI to ATA Translation
              (SAT).  This is for ATA disks that have a SCSI to  ATA  Transla-
              tion  Layer  (SATL)  between  the disk and the operating system.
              SAT defines two ATA PASS THROUGH SCSI  commands,  one  12  bytes
              long  and  the  other 16 bytes long.  The default is the 16 byte
              variant which can be overridden with either '-d sat,12'  or  '-d
              sat,16'.

              If  '-d  sat,auto'  is  specified, device type SAT (for ATA/SATA
              disks) is only used if the SCSI  INQUIRY  data  reports  a  SATL
              (VENDOR:  "ATA     ").  Otherwise device type SCSI (for SCSI/SAS
              disks) is used.

              usbcypress - this device type is for ATA disks that are behind a
              Cypress USB to PATA bridge.  This will use the ATACB proprietary
              scsi pass through command.  The default SCSI operation  code  is
              0x24,  but  although  it  can  be  overridden  with  '-d  usbcy-
              press,0xN', where N is the scsi operation code,  you're  running
              the risk of damage to the device or filesystems on it.

              usbjmicron[,p][,x][,PORT]  -  this device type is for SATA disks
              that are behind a JMicron USB to PATA/SATA bridge.   The  48-bit
              ATA  commands  (required e.g. for '-l xerror', see below) do not
              work with all of these bridges and are therefore disabled by de-
              fault.   These commands can be enabled by '-d usbjmicron,x'.  If
              two disks are connected to a bridge with  two  ports,  an  error
              message  is  printed  if  no PORT is specified.  The port can be
              specified by '-d usbjmicron[,x],PORT' where PORT is  0  (master)
              or  1  (slave).  This is not necessary if the device uses a port
              multiplier to connect multiple disks to one port.  The disks ap-
              pear  under  separate  /dev/ice names then.  CAUTION: Specifying
              ',x' for a device which does not support it results in  I/O  er-
              rors  and  may  disconnect  the  drive.  The same applies if the
              specified PORT does not exist or is not connected to a disk.

              The Prolific PL2507/3507 USB bridges with older firmware support
              a pass-through command similar to JMicron and work with '-d usb-
              jmicron,0'.  Newer Prolific firmware requires a modified command
              which can be selected by '-d usbjmicron,p'.  Note that this does
              not yet support the SMART status command.

              usbprolific - this device type is for SATA disks that are behind
              a Prolific PL2571/2771/2773/2775 USB to SATA bridge.

              usbsunplus  - this device type is for SATA disks that are behind
              a SunplusIT USB to SATA bridge.

              sntasmedia - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTCTL  FEATURE]  this  device
              type  is  for  NVMe disks that are behind an ASMedia USB to NVMe
              bridge.

              sntjmicron[,NSID] - this device type is for NVMe disks that  are
              behind  a  JMicron  USB  to NVMe bridge.  The optional parameter
              NSID specifies the namespace id (in hex) passed to  the  driver.
              The   default   namespace  id  is  the  broadcast  namespace  id
              (0xffffffff).

              sntrealtek - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTCTL  FEATURE]  this  device
              type  is  for  NVMe  disks that are behind a Realtek USB to NVMe
              bridge.

              marvell - [Linux only] interact with SATA disks  behind  Marvell
              chip-set  controllers  (using  the  Marvell  rather  than libata
              driver).

              megaraid,N - [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one
              or  more SCSI/SAS disks connected to a MegaRAID controller.  The
              non-negative integer N (in the range of 0 to 127 inclusive)  de-
              notes  which disk on the controller is monitored. This interface
              will also work for Dell PERC controllers.  Use syntax such as:
              smartctl -a -d megaraid,2 /dev/sda
              smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/sdb
              smartctl -a -d megaraid,0 /dev/bus/0
              It is possible to set RAID device name as /dev/bus/N, where N is
              a SCSI bus number.

              The following entry in /proc/devices must exist:
              For PERC2/3/4 controllers: megadevN
              For PERC5/6 controllers: megaraid_sas_ioctlN

              aacraid,H,L,ID  -  [Linux,  Windows  and Cygwin only] the device
              consists of one or more SCSI/SAS or SATA disks connected  to  an
              AacRaid controller.  The non-negative integers H,L,ID (Host num-
              ber, Lun, ID) denote which disk on the controller is  monitored.
              Use syntax such as:
              smartctl -a -d aacraid,0,0,2 /dev/sda
              smartctl -a -d aacraid,1,0,4 /dev/sdb

              Option  '-d  sat,auto+...'  is implicitly enabled to detect SATA
              disks.  Use '-d scsi+aacraid,H,L,ID' to disable it.

              On Linux, the following entry in /proc/devices must exist:  aac.
              Character  device nodes /dev/aacH (H=Host number) are created if
              required.

              3ware,N - [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one or
              more  ATA  disks connected to a 3ware RAID controller.  The non-
              negative integer N (in the range from 0 to  127  inclusive)  de-
              notes  which  disk  on  the controller is monitored.  Use syntax
              such as:
              smartctl -a -d 3ware,2 /dev/sda  [Linux only]
              smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0
              smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twa0
              smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/twl0 [Linux only]
              smartctl -a -d 3ware,1 /dev/tws0 [FreeBSD only]
              The first two forms, which refer to devices  /dev/sda-z  (depre-
              cated)  and  /dev/twe0-15,  may  be used with 3ware series 6000,
              7000, and 8000 series controllers that use the  3x-xxxx  driver.
              The  devices  /dev/twa0-15,  must be used with 3ware 9000 series
              controllers,  which  use  the  3w-9xxx  driver.    The   devices
              /dev/twl0-15 [Linux] or /dev/tws0-15 [FreeBSD] must be used with
              the 3ware/LSI 9750  series  controllers  which  use  the  3w-sas
              driver.

              Note  that  if  the special character device nodes /dev/tw[ls]?,
              /dev/twa?  and /dev/twe? do not exist, or exist with the  incor-
              rect  major or minor numbers, smartctl will recreate them on the
              fly.

              areca,N - [FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Cygwin only]  the  device
              consists  of  one  or more SATA disks connected to an Areca SATA
              RAID controller.  The positive integer N (in the range from 1 to
              24 inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is monitored.
              On Linux use syntax such as:
              smartctl -a -d areca,2 /dev/sg2
              smartctl -a -d areca,3 /dev/sg3
              The first line above addresses the  second  disk  on  the  first
              Areca RAID controller.  The second line addresses the third disk
              on the second Areca RAID controller.  To help identify the  cor-
              rect device on Linux, use the command:
              cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices
              to  show  the  SCSI generic devices (one per line, starting with
              /dev/sg0).  The correct SCSI  generic  devices  to  address  for
              smartmontools  are  the ones with the type field equal to 3.  If
              the incorrect device is addressed, please read the warning/error
              messages  carefully.   They  should provide hints about what de-
              vices to use.

              Important: the Areca controller must have firmware version  1.46
              or later.  Lower-numbered firmware versions will give (harmless)
              SCSI error messages and no SMART information.

              areca,N/E - [FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Cygwin only] the device
              consists  of one or more SATA or SAS disks connected to an Areca
              SAS RAID controller.  The integer N (range 1 to 128) denotes the
              channel  (slot) and E (range 1 to 8) denotes the enclosure.  Im-
              portant: This requires Areca  SAS  controller  firmware  version
              1.51 or later.

              cciss,N - [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of one or
              more SCSI/SAS or SATA disks  connected  to  a  cciss  RAID  con-
              troller.   The non-negative integer N (in the range from 0 to 15
              inclusive) denotes which disk on the controller is monitored.

              Option '-d sat,auto+...' is implicitly enabled  to  detect  SATA
              disks.  Use '-d scsi+cciss,N' to disable it.

              To  look  at disks behind HP Smart Array controllers, use syntax
              such as:
              smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/cciss/c0d0     (cciss  driver  under
              Linux)
              smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/sg2    (hpsa or hpahcisr drivers un-
              der Linux)

              hpt,L/M/N - [FreeBSD and Linux only] the device consists of  one
              or  more  ATA  disks  connected  to  a HighPoint RocketRAID con-
              troller.  The integer L is the controller id, the integer  M  is
              the channel number, and the integer N is the PMPort number if it
              is available.  The allowed values of L are from 1  to  4  inclu-
              sive,  M are from 1 to 128 inclusive and N from 1 to 4 if PMPort
              available.  And also these values are limited by  the  model  of
              the HighPoint RocketRAID controller.  Use syntax such as:
              smartctl -a -d hpt,1/3 /dev/sda    (under Linux)
              smartctl -a -d hpt,1/2/3 /dev/sda    (under Linux)
              Note  that  the  /dev/sda-z form should be the device node which
              stands for the disks derived from the HighPoint RocketRAID  con-
              trollers  under Linux and under FreeBSD, it is the character de-
              vice which the driver registered (eg, /dev/hptrr, /dev/hptmv6).

              intelliprop,N[+TYPE] - the device consists of multiple ATA disks
              connected  to  an  Intelliprop controller.  The integer N is the
              port number from 0 to 3 of the ATA drive to  be  targeted.   The
              TYPE can be ata(default), sat, or a USB controller listed above.
              Note: if a type of ATA does not work, try a type  of  sat.   Use
              syntax such as:
              smartctl -a -d intelliprop,1 /dev/sda    (under Linux)
              smartctl -a -d intelliprop,1+sat /dev/sda    (under Linux)
              WARNING: The disks are selected by write commands to the ATA De-
              vice Vendor Specific Log at address  0xc0.   Using  this  option
              with other devices may have undesirable side effects.

              jmb39x[-q],N[,sLBA][,force][+TYPE]  - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL
              FEATURE] the device consists of multiple SATA disks connected to
              a  JMicron JMB39x RAID port multiplier.  The suffix '-q' selects
              a slightly different command variant used by some QNAP  NAS  de-
              vices.  The integer N is the port number from 0 to 4.
              WARNING: The ATA pass-through commands are issued via READ/WRITE
              commands to LBA 33 of the RAID volume.  Using this  option  with
              other devices may overwrite this sector.
              The LBA could be selected in the range 33 (last sector of a GPT)
              to 62 (last sector of traditional boot area).
              By default, access to the device is refused if the selected sec-
              tor is not zero filled.  The 'force' flag disables this check.

              jms56x,N[,sLBA][,force][+TYPE] - [NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEA-
              TURE]  the device consists of multiple SATA disks connected to a
              JMicron JMS56x USB to SATA RAID bridge.  See  'jmb39x...'  above
              for valid arguments.

       -T TYPE, --tolerance=TYPE
              [ATA  only] Specifies how tolerant smartctl should be of ATA and
              SMART command failures.

              The behavior of smartctl depends upon  whether  the  command  is
              "optional"  or "mandatory".  Here "mandatory" means "required by
              the ATA Specification if the device implements the SMART command
              set" and "optional" means "not required by the ATA Specification
              even if the device  implements  the  SMART  command  set."   The
              "mandatory" ATA and SMART commands are: (1) ATA IDENTIFY DEVICE,
              (2) SMART  ENABLE/DISABLE  ATTRIBUTE  AUTOSAVE,  (3)  SMART  EN-
              ABLE/DISABLE, and (4) SMART RETURN STATUS.

              The valid arguments to this option are:

              normal - exit on failure of any mandatory SMART command, and ig-
              nore all failures of optional SMART commands.  This is  the  de-
              fault.   Note  that  on  some devices, issuing unimplemented op-
              tional SMART commands doesn't cause an error.  This  can  result
              in  misleading  smartctl  messages such as "Feature X not imple-
              mented", followed shortly by "Feature X: enabled".  In most such
              cases, contrary to the final message, Feature X is not enabled.

              conservative - exit on failure of any optional SMART command.

              permissive  -  ignore  failure(s)  of  mandatory SMART commands.
              This option may be given more than once.  Each additional use of
              this  option  will  cause  one more additional failure to be ig-
              nored.  Note that the use of this option can  lead  to  messages
              like  "Feature  X not supported", followed shortly by "Feature X
              enable failed".  In a few such cases, contrary to the final mes-
              sage, Feature X is enabled.

              verypermissive - equivalent to giving a large number of '-T per-
              missive' options: ignore failures of  any  number  of  mandatory
              SMART commands.  Please see the note above.

       -b TYPE, --badsum=TYPE
              [ATA only] Specifies the action smartctl should take if a check-
              sum error is detected in the: (1) Device Identity Structure, (2)
              SMART  Self-Test Log Structure, (3) SMART Attribute Value Struc-
              ture, (4) SMART Attribute Threshold Structure, or (5) ATA  Error
              Log Structure.

              The valid arguments to this option are:

              warn  -  report  the incorrect checksum but carry on in spite of
              it.  This is the default.

              exit - exit smartctl.

              ignore - continue silently without issuing a warning.

       -r TYPE, --report=TYPE
              Intended primarily to help smartmontools  developers  understand
              the  behavior  of smartmontools on non-conforming or poorly con-
              forming hardware.   This  option  reports  details  of  smartctl
              transactions  with  the device.  The option can be used multiple
              times.  When used just once, it shows a record  of  the  ioctl()
              transactions with the device.  When used more than once, the de-
              tail of these ioctl() transactions are reported in  greater  de-
              tail.  The valid arguments to this option are:

              ioctl - report all ioctl() transactions.

              ataioctl - report only ioctl() transactions with ATA devices.

              scsiioctl  - report only ioctl() transactions with SCSI devices.
              Invoking this once shows the SCSI commands in hex and the corre-
              sponding  status.   Invoking it a second time adds a hex listing
              of the first 64 bytes of data send to, or received from the  de-
              vice.

              nvmeioctl - report only ioctl() transactions with NVMe devices.

              Any argument may include a positive integer to specify the level
              of detail that should be reported.  The argument should be  fol-
              lowed  by a comma then the integer with no spaces.  For example,
              ataioctl,2 The default level is 1, so '-r  ataioctl,1'  and  '-r
              ataioctl' are equivalent.

              For testing purposes, the output of '-r ataioctl,2' can later be
              parsed by smartctl itself if '-' is used as  device  path  argu-
              ment.   The ATA command input parameters, sector data and return
              values are reconstructed from the debug report read from  stdin.
              Then  smartctl  internally simulates an ATA device with the same
              behaviour.  This is does not work for SCSI devices yet.

       -n POWERMODE[,STATUS[,STATUS2]], --nocheck=POWERMODE[,STATUS[,STATUS2]]
              [ATA] [SCSI: NEW EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTCTL  FEATURE]  Specifies  if
              smartctl  should  exit before performing any checks when the de-
              vice is in a low-power mode.  It may be used to prevent  a  disk
              from  being  spun-up  by smartctl.  The power mode is ignored by
              default.

              Note: If this option is used it may also be necessary to specify
              the  device type with the '-d' option.  Otherwise the device may
              spin up due to commands issued during device type autodetection.

              By default, exit status 2 is returned if the device is in one of
              the  specified low-power modes.  This status is also returned if
              the device open or identification failed (see  EXIT  STATUS  be-
              low).  The optional STATUS parameter allows one to override this
              default.  STATUS is an integer in the range from 0 to 255 inclu-
              sive.  For example use '-n standby,0' to return success if a de-
              vice is in SLEEP or STANDBY mode.  Use '-n standby,3' to  return
              a unique exit status in this case.

              The valid arguments to this option are:

              never  -  check  the  device always, but print the power mode if
              '-i' is specified.

              sleep[,STATUS[,STATUS2]] - check the  device  unless  it  is  in
              SLEEP mode.

              standby[,STATUS[,STATUS2]]  -  check  the device unless it is in
              SLEEP or STANDBY mode.  In these modes most disks are not  spin-
              ning, so if you want to prevent a disk from spinning up, this is
              probably what you want.

              idle[,STATUS[,STATUS2]] - check  the  device  unless  it  is  in
              SLEEP,  STANDBY or IDLE mode.  In the IDLE state, most disks are
              still spinning, so this is probably not what you want.

              The '-n' option is ignored if the power mode check is  not  sup-
              ported or returns an unknown value.
              [ATA  only][NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTCTL FEATURE] If the optional
              STATUS2 parameter is specified, smartctl exits immediately  with
              STATUS2  in  this case.  For example use '-n standby,3,5' to re-
              turn unique exit statuses in the STANDBY and UNSUPPORTED cases.

       SMART FEATURE ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS:

              Note: if multiple options are used to both enable and disable  a
              feature,  then  both the enable and disable commands will be is-
              sued.  The enable command will always be issued before the  cor-
              responding disable command.

       -s VALUE, --smart=VALUE
              Enables  or  disables  SMART  on device.  The valid arguments to
              this option are on and off.

              [ATA] Note that the ATA commands SMART ENABLE/DISABLE OPERATIONS
              were declared obsolete in ATA ACS-4 Revision 10 (Nov 2015).

              [SCSI  tape drive or changer] It is not necessary (or useful) to
              enable SMART to see the TapeAlert messages.

       -o VALUE, --offlineauto=VALUE
              [ATA only] Enables or disables  SMART  automatic  offline  test,
              which  scans  the drive every four hours for disk defects.  This
              command can be given during normal system operation.  The  valid
              arguments to this option are on and off.

              Note  that the SMART automatic offline test command is listed as
              "Obsolete" in every version of the ATA and ATA/ATAPI  Specifica-
              tions.   It  was  originally  part of the SFF-8035i Revision 2.0
              specification, but was never  part  of  any  ATA  specification.
              However  it  is  implemented  and used by many vendors.  You can
              tell if automatic offline testing is supported by seeing if this
              command  enables and disables it, as indicated by the 'Auto Off-
              line Data Collection' part  of  the  SMART  capabilities  report
              (displayed with '-c').

              SMART  provides  three  basic  categories of testing.  The first
              category, called "online" testing, has no effect on the  perfor-
              mance of the device.  It is turned on by the '-s on' option.

              The  second  category  of  testing  is called "offline" testing.
              This type of test can, in principle, degrade the device  perfor-
              mance.   The  '-o  on'  option causes this offline testing to be
              carried out, automatically, on a regular scheduled basis.   Nor-
              mally, the disk will suspend offline testing while disk accesses
              are taking place, and then automatically resume it when the disk
              would  otherwise  be  idle, so in practice it has little effect.
              Note that a one-time offline test can also be carried out  imme-
              diately  upon  receipt  of a user command.  See the '-t offline'
              option below, which causes a one-time offline test to be carried
              out immediately.

              The choice (made by the SFF-8035i and ATA specification authors)
              of the word testing for these first two categories  is  unfortu-
              nate,  and  often  leads  to confusion.  In fact these first two
              categories of online and offline testing could  have  been  more
              accurately described as online and offline data collection.

              The results of this automatic or immediate offline testing (data
              collection) are reflected in the values of the SMART Attributes.
              Thus,  if  problems  or errors are detected, the values of these
              Attributes will go below their failure thresholds; some types of
              errors  may also appear in the SMART error log.  These are visi-
              ble with the '-A' and '-l error' options respectively.

              Some SMART attribute values are  updated  only  during  off-line
              data  collection  activities; the rest are updated during normal
              operation of the device or during both normal operation and off-
              line  testing.   The  Attribute value table produced by the '-A'
              option indicates this in the UPDATED column.  Attributes of  the
              first  type  are  labeled "Offline" and Attributes of the second
              type are labeled "Always".

              The third category of testing (and the only category  for  which
              the  word  'testing'  is really an appropriate choice) is "self"
              testing.  This third type of test  is  only  performed  (immedi-
              ately)  when  a  command to run it is issued.  The '-t' and '-X'
              options can be used to carry  out  and  abort  such  self-tests;
              please see below for further details.

              Any  errors  detected  in  the self testing will be shown in the
              SMART self-test log, which can be examined using the  '-l  self-
              test' option.

              Note: in this manual page, the word "Test" is used in connection
              with the second category just described, e.g. for the  "offline"
              testing.   The words "Self-test" are used in connection with the
              third category.

       -S VALUE, --saveauto=VALUE
              [ATA] Enables or disables SMART autosave of  device  vendor-spe-
              cific Attributes.  The valid arguments to this option are on and
              off.  Note that this feature is preserved across disk power  cy-
              cles, so you should only need to issue it once.

              The  ATA  standard  does  not  specify a method to check whether
              SMART autosave is enabled.  Unlike SCSI (below), smartctl is un-
              able to print a warning if autosave is disabled.

              Note  that  the  ATA commands SMART ENABLE/DISABLE AUTOSAVE were
              declared obsolete in ATA ACS-4 Revision 10 (Nov 2015).

              [SCSI] For SCSI devices this toggles the  value  of  the  Global
              Logging  Target  Save  Disabled  (GLTSD) bit in the Control Mode
              Page.  Some disk manufacturers set this bit  by  default.   This
              prevents  error  counters,  power-up hours and other useful data
              from being placed in non-volatile storage, so these  values  may
              be  reset  to zero the next time the device is power-cycled.  If
              the GLTSD bit is set then 'smartctl -a' will  issue  a  warning.
              Use on to clear the GLTSD bit and thus enable saving counters to
              non-volatile storage.  For extreme streaming-video type applica-
              tions you might consider using off to set the GLTSD bit.

       -g NAME, --get=NAME, -s NAME[,VALUE], --set=NAME[,VALUE]
              Gets/sets  non-SMART device settings.  Note that the '--set' op-
              tion shares its short option '-s' with '--smart'.   Valid  argu-
              ments are:

              all - Gets all values.  This is equivalent to
              '-g  aam  -g apm -g lookahead -g security -g wcache -g rcache -g
              dsn'

              aam[,N|off] - [ATA only] Gets/sets the Automatic  Acoustic  Man-
              agement  (AAM)  feature (if supported).  A value of 128 sets the
              most quiet (slowest) mode and 254 the  fastest  (loudest)  mode,
              'off'  disables  AAM.   Devices may support intermediate levels.
              Values below 128 are defined as vendor specific (0)  or  retired
              (1  to 127).  Note that the AAM feature was declared obsolete in
              ATA ACS-2 Revision 4a (Dec 2010).

              apm[,N|off] - [ATA only] Gets/sets the Advanced Power Management
              (APM)  feature  on  device (if supported).  If a value between 1
              and 254 is provided, it will attempt to enable APM and  set  the
              specified  value,  'off' disables APM.  Note the actual behavior
              depends on the drive, for example some  drives  disable  APM  if
              their  value is set above 128.  Values below 128 are supposed to
              allow drive spindown, values 128 and  above  adjust  only  head-
              parking  frequency, although the actual behavior defined is also
              vendor-specific.

              lookahead[,on|off] - [ATA only] Gets/sets  the  read  look-ahead
              feature  (if  supported).  Read look-ahead is usually enabled by
              default.

              security - [ATA only] Gets the status of  ATA  Security  feature
              (if supported).  If ATA Security is enabled an ATA user password
              is set.  The drive will be locked on next reset then.

              security-freeze - [ATA only] Sets ATA Security feature to frozen
              mode.   This  prevents  that the drive accepts any security com-
              mands until next reset.  Note that the frozen mode  may  already
              be set by BIOS or OS.

              standby,[N|off]  -  [ATA]  Sets the standby (spindown) timer and
              places the drive in the IDLE mode.  A value of 0 or  'off'  dis-
              ables  the standby timer.  Values from 1 to 240 specify timeouts
              from 5 seconds to 20 minutes in  5  second  increments.   Values
              from  241 to 251 specify timeouts from 30 minutes to 330 minutes
              in 30 minute increments.  Value 252 specifies 21 minutes.  Value
              253  specifies  a  vendor  specific time between 8 and 12 hours.
              Value 255 specifies 21 minutes and 15 seconds.  Some drives  may
              use  a vendor specific interpretation for the values.  Note that
              there is no get option because ATA standards do  not  specify  a
              method  to  read the standby timer.  If '-s standby,now' is also
              specified, the drive is immediately placed in the  STANDBY  mode
              without  temporarily placing it in the IDLE mode.  Note that ATA
              standards do not specify a command  to  set  the  standby  timer
              without affecting the power mode.
              [SCSI:  NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTCTL FEATURE] Only the set option
              with 'standby,off' or 'standby,0' is accepted and will place the
              SCSI disk into "ACTIVE" power condition.

              standby,now  - [ATA] Places the drive in the STANDBY mode.  This
              usually spins down the drive.  The setting of the standby  timer
              is not affected unless '-s standby,[N|off]' is also specified.
              [SCSI: NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] Only the set option is
              accepted and will place the SCSI  disk  into  "STANDBY_Z"  power
              condition.

              wcache[,on|off]  - [ATA] Gets/sets the volatile write cache fea-
              ture (if supported).  The write cache is usually enabled by  de-
              fault.

              wcache[,on|off]  -  [SCSI]  Gets/sets  the  'Write Cache Enable'
              (WCE) bit (if supported).  The write cache is usually enabled by
              default.

              wcache-sct[,ata|on|off[,p]]  -  [ATA  only]  Gets/sets the write
              cache feature through SCT Feature Control (if  supported).   The
              state of write cache in SCT Feature Control could be "Controlled
              by ATA", "Force Enabled", or "Force Disabled".  SCT Feature con-
              trol   overwrites  the  setting  by  ATA  Set  Features  command
              (wcache[,on|off] option).  If SCT  Feature  Control  sets  write
              cache  as  "Force  Enabled"  or "Force Disabled", the setting of
              wcache[,on|off] is ignored by the drive.   SCT  Feature  Control
              usually  sets write cache as "Controlled by ATA" by default.  If
              ',p' is specified, the setting is preserved across power cycles.

              wcreorder[,on|off[,p]] - [ATA only] Gets/sets  Write  Cache  Re-
              ordering.  If it is disabled (off), disk write scheduling is ex-
              ecuted on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.  If Write Cache Re-
              ordering  is enabled (on), then disk write scheduling may be re-
              ordered by the drive.  If write cache is disabled,  the  current
              Write  Cache Reordering state is remembered but has no effect on
              non-cached writes, which are always written  in  the  order  re-
              ceived.   The  state  of Write Cache Reordering has no effect on
              either NCQ or LCQ queued commands.  If ',p'  is  specified,  the
              setting is preserved across power cycles.

              rcache[,on|off] - [SCSI only] Gets/sets the 'Read Cache Disable'
              (RCE) bit.  'Off' value disables read cache (if supported).  The
              read cache is usually enabled by default.

              dsn[,on|off]  -  [ATA  only]  Gets/sets the DSN feature (if sup-
              ported).  The dsn is usually disabled by default.

       SMART READ AND DISPLAY DATA OPTIONS:

       -H, --health
              Prints the health status of the device.

              [SCSI tape drive or changer] For SCSI tape drives the  TapeAlert
              log page is not checked for pending alerts unless this option is
              given twice (see TAPE DRIVES for the rationale).

              If the device reports failing health status, this  means  either
              that the device has already failed, or that it is predicting its
              own failure within the next 24 hours.  If this happens, use  the
              '-a'  option  to get more information, and get your data off the
              disk and to someplace safe as soon as you can.

              [ATA] Health status is obtained by checking the (boolean) result
              returned  by  the SMART RETURN STATUS command.  The return value
              of this ATA command may be unknown due to limitations or bugs in
              some layer (e.g. RAID controller or USB bridge firmware) between
              disk and operating system.  In  this  case,  smartctl  prints  a
              warning  and checks whether any Prefailure SMART Attribute value
              is less than or equal to its threshold (see '-A' below).

              [SCSI] Health status is  obtained  by  checking  the  Additional
              Sense Code (ASC) and Additional Sense Code Qualifier (ASCQ) from
              Informal Exceptions (IE) log page  (if  supported)  and/or  from
              SCSI sense data.

              [SCSI  tape  drive  or  changer] TapeAlert status is obtained by
              reading the TapeAlert log page only when this  option  is  given
              twice.

              [NVMe] NVMe status is obtained by reading the "Critical Warning"
              byte from the SMART/Health Information log.

       -c, --capabilities
              [ATA] Prints only the generic SMART  capabilities.   These  show
              what  SMART features are implemented and how the device will re-
              spond to some of the different SMART commands.  For  example  it
              shows  if the device logs errors, if it supports offline surface
              scanning, and so on.  If the device can  carry  out  self-tests,
              this  option also shows the estimated time required to run those
              tests.

              [NVMe] Prints various NVMe device capabilities obtained from the
              Identify Controller and the Identify Namespace data structure.

       -A, --attributes
              [ATA] Prints only the vendor specific SMART Attributes.  The At-
              tributes are numbered from 1 to 253 and have specific names  and
              ID  numbers.   For  example Attribute 12 is "power cycle count":
              how many times has the disk been powered up.

              Each Attribute has a "Raw"  value,  printed  under  the  heading
              "RAW_VALUE",  and a "Normalized" value printed under the heading
              "VALUE".  [Note: smartctl prints these values in  base-10.]   In
              the  example  just given, the "Raw Value" for Attribute 12 would
              be the actual number of times that the disk has  been  power-cy-
              cled,  for  example  365 if the disk has been turned on once per
              day for exactly one year.  Each vendor uses their own  algorithm
              to convert this "Raw" value to a "Normalized" value in the range
              from 1 to 254.  Please keep in mind that smartctl  only  reports
              the  different  Attribute  types, values, and thresholds as read
              from the device.  It does not carry out the  conversion  between
              "Raw"  and  "Normalized"  values:  this  is  done  by the disk's
              firmware.

              The conversion from Raw value to a quantity with physical  units
              is not specified by the SMART standard.  In most cases, the val-
              ues printed by smartctl are sensible.  For example the  tempera-
              ture Attribute generally has its raw value equal to the tempera-
              ture in Celsius.  However in some cases vendors use unusual con-
              ventions.  For example the Hitachi disk on my laptop reports its
              power-on hours in minutes, not  hours.   Some  IBM  disks  track
              three temperatures rather than one, in their raw values.  And so
              on.

              Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range is  0  to
              255)  which  is printed under the heading "THRESH".  If the Nor-
              malized value is less than or equal to the Threshold value, then
              the  Attribute  is  said  to have failed.  If the Attribute is a
              pre-failure Attribute, then disk failure is imminent.

              Each Attribute also has a "Worst" value shown under the  heading
              "WORST".   This  is the smallest (closest to failure) value that
              the disk has recorded at any time during its lifetime when SMART
              was enabled.  [Note however that some vendors firmware may actu-
              ally  increase  the  "Worst"  value  for  some  "rate-type"  At-
              tributes.]

              The  Attribute  table  printed  out  by  smartctl also shows the
              "TYPE" of the Attribute.  Attributes are  one  of  two  possible
              types:  Pre-failure or Old age.  Pre-failure Attributes are ones
              which, if less than or equal to their threshold values, indicate
              pending  disk  failure.   Old age, or usage Attributes, are ones
              which indicate end-of-product life from old-age or normal  aging
              and wearout, if the Attribute value is less than or equal to the
              threshold.  Please note: the fact that an Attribute is  of  type
              'Pre-fail'  does  not  mean that your disk is about to fail!  It
              only has this meaning  if  the  Attribute's  current  Normalized
              value is less than or equal to the threshold value.

              If  the  Attribute's  current  Normalized  value is less than or
              equal to the threshold value, then the "WHEN_FAILED" column will
              display  "FAILING_NOW".  If not, but the worst recorded value is
              less than or equal to the threshold value, then this column will
              display "In_the_past".  If the "WHEN_FAILED" column has no entry
              (indicated by a dash: '-') then this Attribute is  OK  now  (not
              failing) and has also never failed in the past.

              The  table column labeled "UPDATED" shows if the SMART Attribute
              values are updated during both  normal  operation  and  off-line
              testing, or only during offline testing.  The former are labeled
              "Always" and the latter are labeled "Offline".

              So to summarize: the Raw Attribute  values  are  the  ones  that
              might  have a real physical interpretation, such as "Temperature
              Celsius", "Hours", or "Start-Stop  Cycles".   Each  manufacturer
              converts these, using their detailed knowledge of the disk's op-
              erations and failure modes, to Normalized  Attribute  values  in
              the  range  1-254.   The  current and worst (lowest measured) of
              these Normalized Attribute values are stored on the disk,  along
              with a Threshold value that the manufacturer has determined will
              indicate that the disk is going to fail, or that it has exceeded
              its  design age or aging limit.  smartctl does not calculate any
              of the Attribute values, thresholds, or types, it merely reports
              them from the SMART data on the device.

              Note  that starting with ATA/ATAPI-4, revision 4, the meaning of
              these Attribute fields has been made  entirely  vendor-specific.
              However most newer ATA/SATA disks seem to respect their meaning,
              so we have retained the option of printing the Attribute values.

              Solid-state drives use different meanings for some  of  the  at-
              tributes.   In  this case the attribute name printed by smartctl
              is incorrect unless the drive is already  in  the  smartmontools
              drive database.

              Note  that the ATA command SMART READ DATA was declared obsolete
              in ATA ACS-4 Revision 10 (Nov 2015).

              [SCSI] For SCSI devices the "attributes" are obtained  from  the
              temperature  and  start-stop  cycle  counter log pages.  Certain
              vendor specific attributes are listed if  recognised.   The  at-
              tributes  are  output in a relatively free format (compared with
              ATA disk attributes).

              [NVMe] For NVMe devices the attributes  are  obtained  from  the
              SMART/Health Information log.

       -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
              [ATA only] Selects the output format of the attributes:

              old  - Old smartctl format.  This is the default unless the '-x'
              option is specified.

              brief - New format which fits into 80 columns  (except  in  some
              rare cases).  This format also decodes four additional attribute
              flags.  This is the default if the '-x' option is specified.

              hex,id - Print all attribute IDs as hexadecimal numbers.

              hex,val - Print all normalized values as hexadecimal numbers.

              hex - Same as '-f hex,id -f hex,val'.

       -l TYPE, --log=TYPE
              Prints various device logs.  The valid arguments to this  option
              are:

              error  -  [ATA] prints the Summary SMART error log.  SMART disks
              maintain a log of the most recent five non-trivial errors.   For
              each  of  these  errors, the disk power-on lifetime at which the
              error occurred is recorded,  as  is  the  device  status  (idle,
              standby,  etc)  at the time of the error.  For some common types
              of errors, the Error Register (ER) and Status Register (SR) val-
              ues are decoded and printed as text.  The meanings of these are:
                 ABRT:  Command ABoRTed
                 AMNF:  Address Mark Not Found
                 CCTO:  Command Completion Timed Out
                 EOM:   End Of Media
                 ICRC:  Interface Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) error
                 IDNF:  IDentity Not Found
                 ILI:   (packet command-set specific)
                 MC:    Media Changed
                 MCR:   Media Change Request
                 NM:    No Media
                 obs:   obsolete
                 TK0NF: TracK 0 Not Found
                 UNC:   UNCorrectable Error in Data
                 WP:    Media is Write Protected
              In  addition, up to the last five commands that preceded the er-
              ror are listed, along with a timestamp measured from  the  start
              of the corresponding power cycle.  This is displayed in the form
              Dd+HH:MM:SS.msec where D is the number of days, HH is hours,  MM
              is minutes, SS is seconds and msec is milliseconds.  [Note: this
              time stamp wraps after 2^32 milliseconds, or 49 days 17 hours  2
              minutes  and  47.296  seconds.]   The key ATA disk registers are
              also recorded in the log.  The final column of the error log  is
              a text-string description of the ATA command defined by the Com-
              mand Register (CR) and Feature Register (FR)  values.   Commands
              that are obsolete in the most current spec are listed like this:
              READ LONG (w/ retry) [OBS-4], indicating that the command became
              obsolete with or in the ATA-4 specification.  Similarly, the no-
              tation [RET-N] is used to indicate that a command was retired in
              the  ATA-N  specification.  Some commands are not defined in any
              version of the ATA specification but are in common use  nonethe-
              less; these are marked [NS], meaning non-standard.

              The  ATA  Specification  (ATA  ACS-2  Revision 7, Section A.7.1)
              says: "Error log data structures shall include, but are not lim-
              ited to, Uncorrectable errors, ID Not Found errors for which the
              LBA requested was valid, servo errors, and write  fault  errors.
              Error log data structures shall not include errors attributed to
              the receipt of faulty commands."  The definitions of these terms
              are:
              UNC (UNCorrectable): data is uncorrectable.  This refers to data
              which has been read from the  disk,  but  for  which  the  Error
              Checking  and  Correction  (ECC) codes are inconsistent.  In ef-
              fect, this means that the data can not be read.
              IDNF (ID Not Found): user-accessible address could not be found.
              For READ LOG type commands, IDNF can also indicate that a device
              data log structure checksum was incorrect.

              If the command that caused the error was a READ  or  WRITE  com-
              mand,  then  the  Logical Block Address (LBA) at which the error
              occurred will be printed in base 10 and base 16.  The LBA  is  a
              linear  address,  which  counts  512-byte  sectors  on the disk,
              starting from zero.  (Because of the limitations  of  the  SMART
              error  log, if the LBA is greater than 0xfffffff, then either no
              error log entry will be made, or the error log entry  will  have
              an  incorrect  LBA.   This may happen for drives with a capacity
              greater than 128 GiB or 137 GB.)  On Linux systems the smartmon-
              tools web page has instructions about how to convert the LBA ad-
              dress to the name of the disk file containing the erroneous disk
              sector.

              Please  note  that  some manufacturers ignore the ATA specifica-
              tions, and make entries in the error log if the device  receives
              a command which is not implemented or is not valid.

              error  -  [SCSI]  prints  the error counter log pages for reads,
              write and verifies.  The verify row is only output if it has  an
              element other than zero.

              error[,NUM]  -  [NVMe]  prints  the  NVMe Error Information log.
              Only the 16 most recent log  entries  are  printed  by  default.
              This  number  can be changed by the optional parameter NUM.  The
              maximum number of log entries is vendor specific (in  the  range
              from 1 to 256 inclusive).

              xerror[,NUM][,error] - [ATA only] prints the Extended Comprehen-
              sive SMART error log (General Purpose Log address 0x03).  Unlike
              the  Summary SMART error log (see '-l error' above), it provides
              sufficient space to log the contents of the 48-bit LBA  register
              set introduced with ATA-6.  It also supports logs with more than
              one sector.  Each sector holds up to 4 log entries.  The  actual
              number of log sectors is vendor specific.

              Only the 8 most recent error log entries are printed by default.
              This number can be changed by the optional parameter NUM.

              If ',error' is appended and the Extended Comprehensive SMART er-
              ror  log  is  not  supported, the Summary SMART self-test log is
              printed.

              Please note that recent drives may report errors only in the Ex-
              tended  Comprehensive  SMART error log.  The Summary SMART error
              log may be reported as supported but is always empty then.

              selftest - [ATA] prints the SMART self-test log.  The disk main-
              tains  a  self-test  log  showing the results of the self tests,
              which can be run using the '-t'  option  described  below.   For
              each of the most recent twenty-one self-tests, the log shows the
              type of test (short or extended, off-line or  captive)  and  the
              final status of the test.  If the test did not complete success-
              fully, then the percentage of the test remaining is shown.   The
              time  at  which  the  test took place, measured in hours of disk
              lifetime, is also printed.  [Note: this time stamp  wraps  after
              2^16  hours, or 2730 days and 16 hours, or about 7.5 years.]  If
              any errors were detected, the Logical Block Address (LBA) of the
              first error is printed in decimal notation.

              selftest  -  [SCSI]  the  self-test  log for a SCSI device has a
              slightly different format than for an ATA device.  For  each  of
              the most recent twenty self-tests, it shows the type of test and
              the status (final or in progress) of the test.   SCSI  standards
              use  the  terms "foreground" and "background" (rather than ATA's
              corresponding "captive" and "off-line") and "short"  and  "long"
              (rather  than ATA's corresponding "short" and "extended") to de-
              scribe the type of the test.  The printed segment number is only
              relevant  when  a test fails in the third or later test segment.
              It identifies the test that failed and consists  of  either  the
              number of the segment that failed during the test, or the number
              of the test that failed and the number of the segment  in  which
              the test was run, using a vendor-specific method of putting both
              numbers into a single byte.  The Logical Block Address (LBA)  of
              the  first  error  is  printed in hexadecimal notation.  If pro-
              vided, the SCSI Sense Key (SK), Additional Sense Code (ASC)  and
              Additional  Sense  Code  Qualifier (ASCQ) are also printed.  The
              self tests can be run using the '-t' option described below (us-
              ing the ATA test terminology).

              xselftest[,NUM][,selftest]  -  [ATA  only]  prints  the Extended
              SMART self-test log (General Purpose Log address 0x07).   Unlike
              the  SMART  self-test log (see '-l selftest' above), it supports
              48-bit LBA and logs with more  than  one  sector.   Each  sector
              holds up to 19 log entries.  The actual number of log sectors is
              vendor specific.

              Only the 25 most recent log  entries  are  printed  by  default.
              This number can be changed by the optional parameter NUM.

              If  ',selftest' is appended and the Extended SMART self-test log
              is not supported, the old SMART self-test log is printed.

              selective - [ATA only] Please see the '-t select'  option  below
              for  a description of selective self-tests.  The selective self-
              test log shows the start/end Logical Block  Addresses  (LBA)  of
              each  of the five test spans, and their current test status.  If
              the span is being tested or the remainder of the disk  is  being
              read-scanned,  the  current  65536-sector  block  of  LBAs being
              tested is also displayed.   The  selective  self-test  log  also
              shows  if  a read-scan of the remainder of the disk will be car-
              ried out after the selective self-test has  completed  (see  '-t
              afterselect'  option)  and the time delay before restarting this
              read-scan if it is interrupted (see '-t pending' option).

              directory[,gs] - [ATA only] if the device supports  the  General
              Purpose  Logging  feature set (ATA-6 and above) then this prints
              the Log Directory (the log at address  0).   The  Log  Directory
              shows  what  logs are available and their length in sectors (512
              bytes).  The contents of the logs at address  1  [Summary  SMART
              error log] and at address 6 [SMART self-test log] may be printed
              using the previously-described error and selftest  arguments  to
              this  option.   If  your version of smartctl supports 48-bit ATA
              commands, both the General Purpose Log (GPL) and SMART Log  (SL)
              directories  are  printed in one combined table.  The output can
              be restricted to the GPL directory or SL directory by '-l direc-
              tory,q' or '-l directory,s' respectively.

              background - [SCSI only] the background scan results log outputs
              information derived from Background Media Scans (BMS) done after
              power  up  and/or  periodically  (e.g. every 24 hours) on recent
              SCSI disks.  If supported, the BMS status is output first, indi-
              cating  whether  a background scan is currently underway (and if
              so a progress percentage), the amount of time the disk has  been
              powered  up  and  the  number  of scans already completed.  Then
              there is a header and a line for each background  scan  "event".
              These  will  typically  be either recovered or unrecoverable er-
              rors.  That latter group may need some attention.   There  is  a
              description  of the background scan mechanism in section 4.18 of
              SBC-3 revision 6 (see www.t10.org ).

              scttemp, scttempsts, scttemphist - [ATA only]  prints  the  disk
              temperature  information provided by the SMART Command Transport
              (SCT) commands.  The option 'scttempsts' prints current tempera-
              ture  and temperature ranges returned by the SCT Status command,
              'scttemphist' prints temperature limits and the temperature his-
              tory table returned by the SCT Data Table command, and 'scttemp'
              prints both.  The temperature values are preserved across  power
              cycles.   The  logging  interval  can be configured with the '-l
              scttempint,N[,p]' option, see below.  The SCT commands were  in-
              troduced  in  ATA8-ACS  and  were  also  supported by many ATA-7
              disks.

              scttempint,N[,p] - [ATA only] clears the SCT temperature history
              table  and  sets  the time interval for temperature logging to N
              minutes.  If ',p' is specified, the setting is preserved  across
              power  cycles.   Otherwise,  the setting is volatile and will be
              reverted to the last non-volatile setting by the next  hard  re-
              set.   The  default  interval is vendor specific, typical values
              are 1, 2, or 5 minutes.

              scterc[,READTIME,WRITETIME][,p|reset] - [ATA only] prints values
              and  descriptions  of  the  SCT Error Recovery Control settings.
              These are equivalent to TLER (as used by Western Digital),  CCTL
              (as  used  by Samsung and Hitachi/HGST) and ERC (as used by Sea-
              gate).  READTIME and WRITETIME arguments (deciseconds)  set  the
              specified values.  Values of 0 disable the feature, other values
              less than 65 are probably not supported.   For  RAID  configura-
              tions, this is typically set to 70,70 deciseconds.
              [NEW  EXPERIMENTAL  SMARTCTL FEATURE] If 'scterc,READTIME,WRITE-
              TIME,p' is specified, these time values will be persistent  over
              a  power-on  reset.   If 'scterc,p' is specified, the persistent
              over power-on values are printed.  If 'scterc,reset'  is  speci-
              fied,  all SCT timer settings are restored to the manufacturer's
              default value.  The ',p' and ',reset' options require the device
              to support ATA ACS-4 or higher.

              devstat[,PAGE]  -  [ATA  only] prints values and descriptions of
              the ATA Device Statistics log pages (General Purpose Log address
              0x04).   If  no  PAGE number is specified, entries from all sup-
              ported pages are printed.  If PAGE 0 is specified, the  list  of
              supported pages is printed.  Device Statistics was introduced in
              ACS-2 and is only supported by some recent devices.

              defects[,NUM] - [ATA] prints LBA and hours values from  the  ATA
              Pending  Defects  log  (General Purpose Log address 0x0c).  Only
              the 31 entries from first log page are printed by default.  This
              number  can  be changed by the optional parameter NUM.  The size
              of the log and the order of the  entries  are  vendor  specific.
              The Pending Defects log was introduced in ACS-4 Revision 01 (Mar
              2014).

              defects - [SCSI: NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints  LBAs
              that the background scan was unable to read (i.e. a defect). En-
              tries, if any, show the defective  LBA  and  the  value  of  the
              power-on  hours  (since  manufacture)  when  the background scan
              found the defect. Note these pending defects may appear  in  ad-
              vance of any application trying to read a defective LBA.

              envrep  -  [SCSI only: NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints
              values and descriptions of the SCSI Environmental reporting  log
              page.  This  includes  one  or more temperatures and may include
              relative humidities. Lifetime maximums and minimums are also re-
              ported.

              sataphy[,reset]  - [SATA only] prints values and descriptions of
              the SATA Phy Event Counters (General Purpose Log address  0x11).
              If '-l sataphy,reset' is specified, all counters are reset after
              reading the values.  This  also  works  for  SATA  devices  with
              Packet interface like CD/DVD drives.

              sasphy[,reset]  -  [SAS  (SCSI) only] prints values and descrip-
              tions of the SAS (SSP) Protocol  Specific  log  page  (log  page
              0x18).   If '-l sasphy,reset' is specified, all counters are re-
              set after reading the values.

              tapealert - [SCSI tape drives  and  changers:  NEW  EXPERIMENTAL
              SMARTCTL  FEATURE]  prints  values and descriptions of the (SSC)
              Tape Alert log page. See TAPE DRIVES below for issue  associated
              with printing this log page.

              tapedevstat  -  [SCSI tape drives and changers: NEW EXPERIMENTAL
              SMARTCTL FEATURE] prints values and descriptions  of  the  (SSC)
              Device Statistics log page.

              zdevstat - [SCSI zoned disks: NEW EXPERIMENTAL SMARTCTL FEATURE]
              prints values and descriptions of the Zoned Block Device Statis-
              tics log page (ZBC-2).

              gplog,ADDR[,FIRST[-LAST|+SIZE]]  -  [ATA only] prints a hex dump
              of any log accessible via General Purpose Logging (GPL) feature.
              The log address ADDR is the hex address listed in the log direc-
              tory (see '-l directory'  above).   The  range  of  log  sectors
              (pages)  can  be  specified  by  decimal  values  FIRST-LAST  or
              FIRST+SIZE.  FIRST defaults to 0, SIZE defaults to 1.  LAST  can
              be set to 'max' to specify the last page of the log.

              smartlog,ADDR[,FIRST[-LAST|+SIZE]]  -  [ATA  only]  prints a hex
              dump of any log accessible via SMART Read Log command.  See  '-l
              gplog,...' above for parameter syntax.

              For example, all these commands:
                smartctl -l gplog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda
                smartctl -l gplog,0x80,10+6 /dev/sda
                smartctl -l smartlog,0x80,10-15 /dev/sda
              print pages 10-15 of log 0x80 (first host vendor specific log).

              The  hex  dump  format  is compatible with the 'xxd -r' command.
              This command:
                smartctl -l gplog,0x11 /dev/sda | grep ^0 | xxd -r >log.bin
              writes a binary representation of the one sector log 0x11  (SATA
              Phy Event Counters) to file log.bin.

              nvmelog,PAGE,SIZE  -  [NVMe only] prints a hex dump of the first
              SIZE bytes from the NVMe log with identifier PAGE.   PAGE  is  a
              hexadecimal  number  in  the  range from 0x1 to 0xff.  SIZE is a
              hexadecimal number in the range from 0x4  to  0x4000  (16  KiB).
              WARNING:  Do  not specify the identifier of an unknown log page.
              Reading a log page may have undesirable side effects.

              ssd - [ATA] prints the Solid State Device Statistics  log  page.
              This has the same effect as '-l devstat,7', see above.

              ssd  -  [SCSI]  prints the Solid State Media percentage used en-
              durance indicator.  A value of  0  indicates  as  new  condition
              while  100 indicates the device is at the end of its lifetime as
              projected by the manufacturer.  The value may reach 255.

       -v ID,FORMAT[:BYTEORDER][,NAME], --vendorattribute=ID,FORMAT...
              [ATA only] Sets a vendor-specific raw value print FORMAT, an op-
              tional  BYTEORDER  and  an optional NAME for Attribute ID.  This
              option may be used multiple times.

              The Attribute ID can be in the range 1 to 255.  If 'N' is speci-
              fied as ID, the settings for all Attributes are changed.

              The  optional  BYTEORDER  consists of 1 to 8 characters from the
              set '012345rvwz'.  The characters '0' to '5' select the  byte  0
              to 5 from the 48-bit raw value, 'r' selects the reserved byte of
              the attribute data block, 'v' selects the normalized value,  'w'
              selects  the  worst  value and 'z' inserts a zero byte.  The de-
              fault BYTEORDER is '543210' for all  48-bit  formats,  'r543210'
              for  the  54-bit formats, and '543210wv' for the 64-bit formats.
              For example, '-v 5,raw48:012345' prints the raw value of  attri-
              bute 5 with big endian instead of little endian byte ordering.

              The  NAME  is  a  string of letters, digits and underscore.  Its
              length should not exceed 23 characters.  The '-P showall' option
              reports an error if this is the case.

              -v  help  -  Prints (to STDOUT) a list of all valid arguments to
              this option, then exits.

              Valid arguments for FORMAT are:

              raw8 - Print the Raw value as six 8-bit unsigned  base-10  inte-
              gers.   This  may  be useful for decoding the meaning of the Raw
              value.

              raw16 - Print the Raw value as three 16-bit unsigned base-10 in-
              tegers.   This may be useful for decoding the meaning of the Raw
              value.

              raw48 - Print the Raw value as a 48-bit unsigned  base-10  inte-
              ger.  This is the default for most attributes.

              hex48  -  Print  the Raw value as a 12 digit hexadecimal number.
              This may be useful for decoding the meaning of the Raw value.

              raw56 - Print the Raw value as a 54-bit unsigned  base-10  inte-
              ger.   This  includes the reserved byte which follows the 48-bit
              raw value.

              hex56 - Print the Raw value as a 14  digit  hexadecimal  number.
              This  includes  the  reserved  byte which follows the 48-bit raw
              value.

              raw64 - Print the Raw value as a 64-bit unsigned  base-10  inte-
              ger.   This includes two bytes from the normalized and worst at-
              tribute value.  This raw format is used by some SSD devices with
              Indilinx controller.

              hex64  -  Print  the Raw value as a 16 digit hexadecimal number.
              This includes two bytes from the normalized and worst  attribute
              value.   This raw format is used by some SSD devices with Indil-
              inx controller.

              min2hour - Raw Attribute is power-on time in minutes.   Its  raw
              value  will  be displayed in the form "Xh+Ym".  Here X is hours,
              and Y is minutes in the  range  0-59  inclusive.   Y  is  always
              printed with two digits, for example "06" or "31" or "00".

              sec2hour  -  Raw Attribute is power-on time in seconds.  Its raw
              value will be displayed in  the  form  "Xh+Ym+Zs".   Here  X  is
              hours,  Y  is minutes in the range 0-59 inclusive, and Z is sec-
              onds in the range 0-59 inclusive.  Y and Z  are  always  printed
              with two digits, for example "06" or "31" or "00".

              halfmin2hour - Raw Attribute is power-on time, measured in units
              of 30 seconds.  This format is used by some Samsung disks.   Its
              raw  value  will  be  displayed  in the form "Xh+Ym".  Here X is
              hours, and Y is minutes in the range 0-59 inclusive.  Y  is  al-
              ways printed with two digits, for example "06" or "31" or "00".

              msec24hour32 - Raw Attribute is power-on time measured in 32-bit
              hours and 24-bit milliseconds since last hour update.   It  will
              be  displayed  in  the form "Xh+Ym+Z.Ms".  Here X is hours, Y is
              minutes, Z is seconds and M is milliseconds.

              tempminmax - Raw Attribute is the disk temperature  in  Celsius.
              Info about Min/Max temperature is printed if available.  This is
              the default for Attributes 190 and 194.  The recording  interval
              (lifetime,  last  power  cycle,  last soft reset) of the min/max
              values is device specific.

              temp10x - Raw Attribute is ten times  the  disk  temperature  in
              Celsius.

              raw16(raw16) - Print the raw attribute as a 16-bit value and two
              optional 16-bit values if these words are nonzero.  This is  the
              default for Attributes 5 and 196.

              raw16(avg16)  - Raw attribute is spin-up time.  It is printed as
              a 16-bit value and an optional "Average"  16-bit  value  if  the
              word is nonzero.  This is the default for Attribute 3.

              raw24(raw8)  -  Print  the  raw  attribute as a 24-bit value and
              three optional 8-bit values if these bytes are nonzero.  This is
              the default for Attribute 9.

              raw24/raw24  -  Raw  Attribute  contains two 24-bit values.  The
              first is the number of load cycles.  The second is the number of
              unload  cycles.   The difference between these two values is the
              number of times that the  drive  was  unexpectedly  powered  off
              (also  called an emergency unload).  As a rule of thumb, the me-
              chanical stress created by one emergency unload is equivalent to
              that created by one hundred normal unloads.

              raw24/raw32 - Raw attribute is an error rate which consists of a
              24-bit error count and a 32-bit total count.

              The following old arguments to '-v' are also still valid:

              9,minutes - same as: 9,min2hour,Power_On_Minutes.

              9,seconds - same as: 9,sec2hour,Power_On_Seconds.

              9,halfminutes - same as: 9,halfmin2hour,Power_On_Half_Minutes.

              9,temp - same as: 9,tempminmax,Temperature_Celsius.

              192,emergencyretractcyclect  -  same   as:   192,raw48,Emerg_Re-
              tract_Cycle_Ct

              is  not  reset  if  uncorrectable  sectors  are reallocated (see
              smartd.conf(5) man page).

              198,increasing  -  same  as:  198,raw48,Total_Offl_Uncorrectabl.
              Also means that Attribute number 198 (Offline Uncorrectable Sec-
              tor Count) is not reset if uncorrectable sectors are reallocated
              (see smartd.conf(5) man page).

       -F TYPE, --firmwarebug=TYPE
              [ATA only] Modifies the behavior of smartctl to  compensate  for
              some  known  and understood device firmware or driver bug.  This
              option may be used multiple times.  The valid arguments are:

              none - Assume that the device firmware obeys the ATA  specifica-
              tions.   This  is the default, unless the device has presets for
              '-F' in the drive database.  Using this option  on  the  command
              line will override any preset values.

              nologdir  -  Suppresses  read attempts of SMART or GP Log Direc-
              tory.  Support for all standard logs is assumed without  an  ac-
              tual  check.   Some  Intel  SSDs  may freeze if log address 0 is
              read.

              samsung - In some Samsung disks (example: model SV4012H Firmware
              Version:  RM100-08) some of the two- and four-byte quantities in
              the SMART data structures are byte-swapped (relative to the  ATA
              specification).  Enabling this option tells smartctl to evaluate
              these quantities in byte-reversed order.  Some signs  that  your
              disk  needs  this  option are (1) no self-test log printed, even
              though you have run self-tests; (2) very large  numbers  of  ATA
              errors reported in the ATA error log; (3) strange and impossible
              values for the ATA error log timestamps.

              samsung2 - In some Samsung disks the number of  ATA  errors  re-
              ported  is byte swapped.  Enabling this option tells smartctl to
              evaluate this quantity in byte-reversed  order.   An  indication
              that  your  Samsung disk needs this option is that the self-test
              log is printed correctly, but there are a very large  number  of
              errors  in the SMART error log.  This is because the error count
              is byte swapped.  Thus a disk with five errors (0x0005) will ap-
              pear to have 20480 errors (0x5000).

              samsung3  -  Some  Samsung disks (at least SP2514N with Firmware
              VF100-37) report a self-test still in progress with 0% remaining
              when the test was already completed.  Enabling this option modi-
              fies the output of the self-test execution status  (see  options
              '-c' or '-a' above) accordingly.

              xerrorlba  -  Fixes  LBA byte ordering in Extended Comprehensive
              SMART error log.  Some disks use little endian byte ordering in-
              stead  of  ATA register ordering to specify the LBA addresses in
              the log entries.

              swapid - Fixes byte swapped ATA identify strings  (device  name,
              serial  number,  firmware version) returned by some buggy device
              drivers.

       -P TYPE, --presets=TYPE
              [ATA only] Specifies whether smartctl should use any preset  op-
              tions  that  are  available  for this drive.  By default, if the
              drive is recognized in the smartmontools database, then the pre-
              sets are used.

              The  argument  show  will show any preset options for your drive
              and the argument showall will  show  all  known  drives  in  the
              smartmontools  database,  along  with  their preset options.  If
              there are no presets for your drive and you think  there  should
              be  (for example, a -v or -F option is needed to get smartctl to
              display correct values) then please  contact  the  smartmontools
              developers  so  that this information can be added to the smart-
              montools database.  Contact information is at the  end  of  this
              man page.

              The valid arguments to this option are:

              use  - if a drive is recognized, then use the stored presets for
              it.  This is the default.  Note that presets will  NOT  override
              additional  Attribute interpretation ('-v N,something') command-
              line options or explicit '-F' command-line options..

              ignore - do not use presets.

              show - show if the drive is recognized in the database,  and  if
              so, its presets, then exit.

              showall  -  list all recognized drives, and the presets that are
              set for them, then exit.  This also checks  the  drive  database
              regular expressions and settings for syntax errors.

              The  '-P  showall'  option takes up to two optional arguments to
              match a specific drive type and firmware version.  The command:
                smartctl -P showall
              lists all entries, the command:
                smartctl -P showall 'MODEL'
              lists all entries matching MODEL, and the command:
                smartctl -P showall 'MODEL' 'FIRMWARE'
              lists all entries for this MODEL and a  specific  FIRMWARE  ver-
              sion.

       -B [+]FILE, --drivedb=[+]FILE
              [ATA  only] Read the drive database from FILE.  The new database
              replaces the built in database by default.  If '+' is specified,
              then the new entries prepend the built in entries.

              Optional  entries are read from the file /etc/smart_drivedb.h if
              this option is not specified.

              If /var/lib/smartmontools/drivedb/drivedb.h is present, the con-
              tents of this file is used instead of the built in table.

              Run  /usr/sbin/update-smart-drivedb to update this file from the
              smartmontools SVN repository.

              The database files use the same C/C++ syntax  that  is  used  to
              initialize  the  built  in database array.  C/C++ style comments
              are allowed.  Example:

                /* Full entry: */
                {
                  "Model family",    // Info about model family/series.
                  "MODEL1.*REGEX",   // Regular expression to match model of device.
                  "VERSION.*REGEX",  // Regular expression to match firmware version(s).
                  "Some warning",    // Warning message.
                  "-v 9,minutes"     // String of preset -v and -F options.
                },
                /* Minimal entry: */
                {
                  "",                // No model family/series info.
                  "MODEL2.*REGEX",   // Regular expression to match model of device.
                  "",                // All firmware versions.
                  "",                // No warning.
                  ""                 // No options preset.
                },
                /* USB ID entry: */
                {
                  "USB: Device; Bridge", // Info about USB device and bridge name.
                  "0x1234:0xabcd",   // Regular expression to match vendor:product ID.
                  "0x0101",          // Regular expression to match bcdDevice.
                  "",                // Not used.
                  "-d sat"           // String with device type option.
                },
                /* ... */

       SMART RUN/ABORT OFFLINE TEST AND self-test OPTIONS:

       -t TEST, --test=TEST
              Executes TEST immediately.  The '-C' option can be used in  con-
              junction with this option to run the short or long (and also for
              ATA devices, selective or conveyance) self-tests in captive mode
              (known  as  "foreground mode" for SCSI devices).  Note that only
              one test type can be run at a time, so only one test type should
              be  specified per command line.  Note also that if a computer is
              shutdown or power cycled during a self-test, no harm should  re-
              sult.  The self-test will either be aborted or will resume auto-
              matically.

              All '-t TEST' commands can be given during normal system  opera-
              tion unless captive mode ('-C' option) is used.  A running self-
              test can, however, degrade performance of the  drive.   Frequent
              I/O  requests from the operating system increase the duration of
              a test.  These impacts may vary from device to device.

              If a test failure occurs then the  device  may  discontinue  the
              testing and report the result immediately.

              [ATA] Note that the ATA command SMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE IMMEDIATE
              (the command to start a test) was declared obsolete in ATA ACS-4
              Revision 10 (Nov 2015).

              The valid arguments to this option are:

              offline - [ATA] runs SMART Immediate Offline Test.  This immedi-
              ately starts the test described  above.   This  command  can  be
              given  during normal system operation.  The effects of this test
              are visible only in that it updates the SMART Attribute  values,
              and if errors are found they will appear in the SMART error log,
              visible with the '-l error' option.

              If the '-c' option to smartctl shows that  the  device  has  the
              "Suspend  Offline  collection  upon new command" capability then
              you can track the progress of the Immediate Offline  test  using
              the  '-c'  option to smartctl.  If the '-c' option show that the
              device has the "Abort Offline collection upon new command" capa-
              bility then most commands will abort the Immediate Offline Test,
              so you should not try to track the progress  of  the  test  with
              '-c', as it will abort the test.

              offline  -  [SCSI] runs the default self test in foreground.  No
              entry is placed in the self test log.

              short - [ATA] runs SMART Short Self Test (usually under ten min-
              utes).  This command can be given during normal system operation
              (unless run in captive mode - see the '-C' option below).   This
              is  a  test  in a different category than the immediate or auto-
              matic offline tests.  The "Self" tests check the electrical  and
              mechanical  performance  as  well as the read performance of the
              disk.  Their results are reported in the Self  Test  Error  Log,
              readable with the '-l selftest' option.  Note that on some disks
              the progress of the self-test can be monitored by watching  this
              log  during  the self-test; with other disks use the '-c' option
              to monitor progress.

              short - [SCSI] runs the "Background short" self-test.

              long - [ATA] runs SMART Extended Self Test (tens of  minutes  to
              several  hours).   This is a longer and more thorough version of
              the Short Self Test described above.  Note that this command can
              be  given  during normal system operation (unless run in captive
              mode - see the '-C' option below).

              long - [SCSI] runs the "Background long" self-test.

              conveyance - [ATA only] runs a SMART Conveyance Self Test  (min-
              utes).   This  self-test  routine is intended to identify damage
              incurred during transporting of the device.  This self-test rou-
              tine should take on the order of minutes to complete.  Note that
              this command can be given during normal system operation (unless
              run in captive mode - see the '-C' option below).

              select,N-M,  select,N+SIZE  -  [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective
              Self Test, to test a  range  of  disk  Logical  Block  Addresses
              (LBAs), rather than the entire disk.  Each range of LBAs that is
              checked is called a "span" and is specified by  a  starting  LBA
              (N)  and  an ending LBA (M) with N less than or equal to M.  The
              range can also be specified as N+SIZE.  A span at the end  of  a
              disk can be specified by N-max.

              For example the commands:
                smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,10+11 /dev/sda
              both  runs  a  self  test  on one span consisting of LBAs ten to
              twenty (inclusive).  The command:
                smartctl -t select,100000000-max /dev/sda
              run a self test from LBA 100000000 up to the end  of  the  disk.
              The  '-t'  option  can  be given up to five times, to test up to
              five spans.  For example the command:
                smartctl -t select,0-100 -t select,1000-2000 /dev/sda
              runs a self test on two spans.  The first span consists  of  101
              LBAs  and  the second span consists of 1001 LBAs.  Note that the
              spans can overlap partially or completely, for example:
                smartctl -t select,0-10 -t select,5-15 -t select,10-20 /dev/sda
              The results of the selective self-test  can  be  obtained  (both
              during  and after the test) by printing the SMART self-test log,
              using the '-l selftest' option to smartctl.

              Selective self tests are particularly useful as disk  capacities
              increase: an extended self test (smartctl -t long) can take sev-
              eral hours.  Selective self-tests are helpful if (based on  SYS-
              LOG  error  messages, previous failed self-tests, or SMART error
              log entries) you suspect that a disk is  having  problems  at  a
              particular range of Logical Block Addresses (LBAs).

              Selective  self-tests  can be run during normal system operation
              (unless done in captive mode - see the '-C' option below).

              The following variants of the selective  self-test  command  use
              spans  based on the ranges from past tests already stored on the
              disk:

              select,redo[+SIZE] - [ATA only] redo the  last  SMART  Selective
              Self Test using the same LBA range.  The starting LBA is identi-
              cal to the LBA used by last test, same for ending LBA  unless  a
              new span size is specified by optional +SIZE argument.

              For example the commands:
                smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,redo /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,redo+20 /dev/sda
              have the same effect as:
                smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,10-20 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,10-29 /dev/sda

              select,next[+SIZE] - [ATA only] runs a SMART Selective Self Test
              on the LBA range which follows the range of the last test.   The
              starting  LBA is set to (ending LBA +1) of the last test.  A new
              span size may be specified by the optional +SIZE argument.

              For example the commands:
                smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,next /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,next+2000 /dev/sda
              have the same effect as:
                smartctl -t select,0-999 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,1000-1999 /dev/sda
                smartctl -t select,2000-3999 /dev/sda

              If the last test ended at the last LBA  of  the  disk,  the  new
              range starts at LBA 0.  The span size of the last span of a disk
              is adjusted such that the total number of  spans  to  check  the
              full  disk  will  not  be  changed  by  future  uses  of '-t se-
              lect,next'.

              select,cont[+SIZE] - [ATA only] performs a 'redo' (above) if the
              self  test  status reports that the last test was aborted by the
              host.  Otherwise it run the 'next' (above) test.

              afterselect,on - [ATA only] perform an offline read scan after a
              Selective self-test has completed.  This option must be used to-
              gether with one or more of the select,N-M options above.  If the
              LBAs  that  have  been specified in the Selective self-test pass
              the test with no errors found, then read scan the  remainder  of
              the  disk.  If the device is powered-cycled while this read scan
              is in progress, the read scan will be automatically resumed  af-
              ter  a  time  specified  by  the pending timer (see below).  The
              value of this option is preserved between selective self-tests.

              afterselect,off - [ATA only] do not read scan the  remainder  of
              the disk after a Selective self-test has completed.  This option
              must be use together with one or more of the select,N-M  options
              above.   The value of this option is preserved between selective
              self-tests.

              pending,N - [ATA only] set the pending offline read  scan  timer
              to N minutes.  Here N is an integer in the range from 0 to 65535
              inclusive.  If the device is powered off during a read scan  af-
              ter  a Selective self-test, then resume the test automatically N
              minutes after power-up.  This option must be use  together  with
              one  or more of the select,N-M options above.  The value of this
              option is preserved between selective self-tests.

              vendor,N - [ATA only] issues the ATA command SMART EXECUTE  OFF-
              LINE  IMMEDIATE with subcommand N in LBA LOW register.  The sub-
              command is specified as a hex value in the range 0x00  to  0xff.
              Subcommands 0x40-0x7e and 0x90-0xff are reserved for vendor spe-
              cific use, see table 61 of T13/1699-D  Revision  6a  (ATA8-ACS).
              Note  that  the  subcommands 0x00-0x04, 0x7f, 0x81-0x84 are sup-
              ported by other smartctl options (e.g. 0x01: '-t  short',  0x7f:
              '-X', 0x82: '-C -t long').

              WARNING:  Only  run  subcommands documented by the vendor of the
              device.

              Example for some Intel SSDs only: The subcommand 0x40 ('-t  ven-
              dor,0x40')  clears  the  timed workload related SMART attributes
              (226, 227, 228).  Note that the raw values of  these  attributes
              are  held  at 65535 (0xffff) until the workload timer reaches 60
              minutes.

              force - start new self-test even if another test is already run-
              ning.  By default a running self-test will not be interrupted to
              begin another test.

       -C, --captive
              [ATA] Runs self-tests in captive mode.  This has no effect  with
              '-t offline' or if the '-t' option is not used.

              WARNING:  Tests  run  in captive mode may busy out the drive for
              the length of the test.  Only run captive tests on drives  with-
              out any mounted partitions!

              [SCSI] Runs the self-test in "Foreground" mode.

       -X, --abort
              Aborts  non-captive  SMART  Self  Tests.  Note that this command
              will abort the Offline Immediate Test routine only if your  disk
              has the "Abort Offline collection upon new command" capability.

COMMAND: hdparm

DESCRIPTION: hdparm - get/set SATA/IDE device parameters

USAGE: hdparm [options] [device ...]

OPTIONS:
When  no  options  are  given, -acdgkmur is assumed.  For "Get/set" op-
       tions, a query without the optional parameter  (e.g.,  -d)  will  query
       (get)  the  device state, and with a parameter (e.g., -d0) will set the
       device state.

       -a     Get/set sector count for filesystem (software) read-ahead.  This
              is  used  to  improve  performance  in sequential reads of large
              files, by prefetching additional blocks in anticipation of  them
              being  needed  by the running task.  Many IDE drives also have a
              separate  built-in  read-ahead  function,  which  augments  this
              filesystem (software) read-ahead function.

       -A     Get/set  the  IDE  drive's read-lookahead feature (usually ON by
              default).  Usage: -A0 (disable) or -A1 (enable).

       -b     Get/set bus state.

       -B     Get/set Advanced Power Management feature, if the drive supports
              it.  A  low  value  means aggressive power management and a high
              value means better performance.  Possible  settings  range  from
              values  1  through  127 (which permit spin-down), and values 128
              through 254 (which do not permit spin-down).  The highest degree
              of  power  management  is  attained with a setting of 1, and the
              highest I/O performance with a setting of 254.  A value  of  255
              tells  hdparm to disable Advanced Power Management altogether on
              the drive (not all drives support disabling it, but most do).

       -c     Get/set (E)IDE 32-bit I/O support.  A numeric parameter  can  be
              used  to enable/disable 32-bit I/O support.  Currently supported
              values include 0 to disable 32-bit  I/O  support,  1  to  enable
              32-bit  data  transfers,  and  3 to enable 32-bit data transfers
              with a special sync sequence required  by  many  chipsets.   The
              value  3  works  with nearly all 32-bit IDE chipsets, but incurs
              slightly more overhead.   Note  that  "32-bit"  refers  to  data
              transfers  across  a  PCI or VLB bus to the interface card only;
              all (E)IDE drives still have only a 16-bit connection  over  the
              ribbon cable from the interface card.

       -C     Check  the  current  IDE power mode status, which will always be
              one of unknown  (drive  does  not  support  this  command),  ac-
              tive/idle (normal operation), standby (low power mode, drive has
              spun down), or sleeping (lowest power mode, drive is  completely
              shut  down).   The -S, -y, -Y, and -Z options can be used to ma-
              nipulate the IDE power modes.

       -d     Get/set the "using_dma" flag for this drive.   This  option  now
              works  with most combinations of drives and PCI interfaces which
              support DMA and which are known to the kernel IDE driver.  It is
              also a good idea to use the appropriate -X option in combination
              with -d1 to ensure that the drive itself is programmed  for  the
              correct  DMA mode, although most BIOSs should do this for you at
              boot time.  Using DMA nearly always gives the best  performance,
              with  fast  I/O  throughput and low CPU usage.  But there are at
              least a few configurations of chipsets and drives for which  DMA
              does not make much of a difference, or may even slow things down
              (on really messed up hardware!).  Your mileage may vary.

       --dco-freeze
              DCO stands for Device Configuration Overlay, a way  for  vendors
              to  selectively disable certain features of a drive.  The --dco-
              freeze option will freeze/lock the current drive  configuration,
              thereby  preventing  software (or malware) from changing any DCO
              settings until after the next power-on reset.

       --dco-identify
              Query and dump information regarding  drive  configuration  set-
              tings  which  can  be  disabled  by the vendor or OEM installer.
              These settings show capabilities of the  drive  which  might  be
              disabled  by the vendor for "enhanced compatibility".  When dis-
              abled, they are otherwise hidden and will not  show  in  the  -I
              identify  output.  For example, system vendors sometimes disable
              48_bit addressing on large drives, for compatibility  (and  loss
              of  capacity)  with a specific BIOS.  In such cases, --dco-iden-
              tify will show that the drive is 48_bit capable, but -I will not
              show it, and nor will the drive accept 48_bit commands.

       --dco-restore
              Reset  all  drive  settings, features, and accessible capacities
              back to factory defaults and full  capabilities.   This  command
              will  fail if DCO is frozen/locked, or if a -Np maximum size re-
              striction has also been set.  This is  EXTREMELY  DANGEROUS  and
              will  very  likely  cause massive loss of data.  DO NOT USE THIS
              COMMAND.

       --direct
              Use the kernel's "O_DIRECT" flag when  performing  a  -t  timing
              test.  This bypasses the page cache, causing the reads to go di-
              rectly from the drive into  hdparm's  buffers,  using  so-called
              "raw"  I/O.  In many cases, this can produce results that appear
              much faster than the usual page cache method,  giving  a  better
              indication of raw device and driver performance.

       --drq-hsm-error
              VERY  DANGEROUS,  DON'T  EVEN THINK ABOUT USING IT.  This option
              causes hdparm to issue an IDENTIFY command to  the  kernel,  but
              incorrectly marked as a "non-data" command.  This results in the
              drive being left with its  DataReQust(DRQ)  line  "stuck"  high.
              This confuses the kernel drivers, and may crash the system imme-
              diately with massive data loss.  The option exists  to  help  in
              testing  and  fortifying  the  kernel against similar real-world
              drive malfunctions.  VERY DANGEROUS, DO NOT USE!!

       -D     Enable/disable the on-drive defect management  feature,  whereby
              the  drive firmware tries to automatically manage defective sec-
              tors by relocating them to "spare" sectors reserved by the  fac-
              tory for such.  Control of this feature via the -D option is not
              supported for most modern drives since ATA-4; thus this  command
              may fail.

       -E     Set cd/dvd drive speed.  This is NOT necessary for regular oper-
              ation, as the drive will automatically switch speeds on its own.
              But  if you want to play with it, just supply a speed number af-
              ter the option, usually a number like 2 or 4.  This can be  use-
              ful in some cases, though, to smooth out DVD video playback.

       -f     Sync  and  flush  the buffer cache for the device on exit.  This
              operation is also performed internally as part of the -t and  -T
              timings and other options.

       --fallocate
              This  option  currently  works  only  on ext4 and xfs filesystem
              types.  When used, this must be the only option given.   It  re-
              quires  two parameters: the desired file size in kibibytes (byte
              count divided by 1024), followed by the  pathname  for  the  new
              file.   It  will  create  a  new file of the specified size, but
              without actually having to write any data  to  the  file.   This
              will  normally  complete very quickly, and without thrashing the
              storage device.

              E.g., create a 10 kibibyte file: hdparm --fallocate 10 temp_file

       --fibmap
              When used, this must be the only option given.   It  requires  a
              file path as a parameter, and will print out a list of the block
              extents (sector ranges) occupied by that file on  disk.   Sector
              numbers  are given as absolute LBA numbers, referenced from sec-
              tor 0 of the physical device rather than from the  partition  or
              filesystem.   This information can then be used for a variety of
              purposes, such as  examining  the  degree  of  fragmentation  of
              larger files, or determining appropriate sectors to deliberately
              corrupt during fault-injection testing procedures.

              This option uses the new FIEMAP (file extent map)  ioctl()  when
              available,  and  falls back to the older FIBMAP (file block map)
              ioctl() otherwise.  Note  that  FIBMAP  suffers  from  a  32-bit
              block-number  interface, and thus not work beyond 8 TB or 16 TB.
              FIBMAP is also very slow, and does not deal well  with  preallo-
              cated  uncommitted  extents  in  ext4/xfs  filesystems, unless a
              sync() is done before using this option.

       --fwdownload
              When used, this should be the only option given.  It requires  a
              file path immediately after the option, indicating where the new
              drive firmware should be read from.  The contents of  this  file
              will  be  sent  to the drive using the (S)ATA DOWNLOAD MICROCODE
              command, using either transfer protocol 7 (entire file at once),
              or,  if  the  drive  supports it, transfer protocol 3 (segmented
              download).  This command is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS  and  could  de-
              stroy  both  the drive and all data on it.  DO NOT USE THIS COM-
              MAND.  The --fwdownload-mode3  ,  --fwdownload-mode3-max  ,  and
              --fwdownload-mode7  variations on basic --fwdownload allow over-
              riding automatic protocol detection in favour of forcing  hdparm
              to use a specific transfer protocol, for testing purposes only.

       -F     Flush  the on-drive write cache buffer (older drives may not im-
              plement this).

       -g     Display the drive geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors), the size
              (in sectors) of the device, and the starting offset (in sectors)
              of the device from the beginning of the drive.

       -h     Display terse usage information (help).

       -H     Read the temperature from some (mostly  Hitachi)  drives.   Also
              reports  if  the temperature is within operating condition range
              (this may not be reliable). Does not cause the drive to spin  up
              if idle.

       -i     Display  the  identification info which the kernel drivers (IDE,
              libata) have stored from boot/configuration time.  This may dif-
              fer  from  the  current information obtainable directly from the
              drive itself with the -I option.  The data returned may  or  may
              not  be current, depending on activity since booting the system.
              For a more detailed interpretation of the  identification  info,
              refer  to  AT  Attachment  Interface  for  Disk Drives, ANSI ASC
              X3T9.2 working draft, revision 4a, April 19/93, and  later  edi-
              tions.

       --idle-immediate
              Issue  an  ATA  IDLE_IMMEDIATE  command, to put the drive into a
              lower power state.  Usually the device remains spun-up.

       --idle-unload
              Issue an ATA IDLE_IMMEDIATE_WITH_UNLOAD command,  to  unload  or
              park the heads and put the drive into a lower power state.  Usu-
              ally the device remains spun-up.

       -I     Request identification info directly from the  drive,  which  is
              displayed in a new expanded format with considerably more detail
              than with the older -i option.

       --Iraw <pathname>
              This option dumps the drive's identify data in raw binary to the
              specified file.

       --Istdin
              This  is  a  special variation on the -I option, which accepts a
              drive identification block as standard input instead of using  a
              /dev/hd*  parameter.   The  format of this block must be exactly
              the same as that found in the /proc/ide/*/hd*/identify  "files",
              or  that produced by the --Istdout option described below.  This
              variation is designed for  use  with  collected  "libraries"  of
              drive  identification information, and can also be used on ATAPI
              drives which may give media errors with the standard  mechanism.
              When  --Istdin  is  used, it must be the *only* parameter given.
              Note that some information will be incomplete, as the drive  LOG
              PAGES are unavailable when --Istdin is used.

       --Istdout
              This option dumps the drive's identify data in hex to stdout, in
              a format similar to that from /proc/ide/*/identify, and suitable
              for later use with the --Istdin option.

       -J     Get/set  the  Western Digital (WD) Green Drive's "idle3" timeout
              value.  This timeout controls how  often  the  drive  parks  its
              heads and enters a low power consumption state.  The factory de-
              fault is eight (8) seconds, which is a very poor choice for  use
              with  Linux.   Leaving it at the default will result in hundreds
              of thousands of head load/unload cycles in a very  short  period
              of  time.   The  drive  mechanism  is  only rated for 300,000 to
              1,000,000 cycles, so leaving it at the default could  result  in
              premature  failure, not to mention the performance impact of the
              drive often having to wake-up before doing routine I/O.

              WD supply a WDIDLE3.EXE DOS utility for tweaking  this  setting,
              and you should use that program instead of hdparm if at all pos-
              sible.  The reverse-engineered implementation in hdparm  is  not
              as  complete  as  the  original official program, even though it
              does seem to work on at a least a few drives.  A full power  cy-
              cle  is  required  for any change in setting to take effect, re-
              gardless of which program is used to tweak things.

              A setting of 30 seconds is recommended for Linux use.  Permitted
              values  are  from 8 to 12 seconds, and from 30 to 300 seconds in
              30-second increments.  Specify a value of zero  (0)  to  disable
              the WD idle3 timer completely (NOT RECOMMENDED!).

       -k     Get/set the "keep_settings_over_reset" flag for the drive.  When
              this flag is set, the drive will preserve the -dmu settings over
              a  soft  reset,  (as  done  during the error recovery sequence).
              This option defaults to off, to prevent drive reset loops  which
              could be caused by combinations of -dmu settings.  The -k option
              should therefore only be set after one has  achieved  confidence
              in  correct  system operation with a chosen set of configuration
              settings.  In practice, all that is typically necessary to  test
              a  configuration (prior to using -k) is to verify that the drive
              can be read/written, and that no error  logs  (kernel  messages)
              are  generated in the process (look in /var/log/messages on most
              systems).

       -K     Set the drive's "keep_features_over_reset" flag.   Setting  this
              enables the drive to retain the settings for -APSWXZ over a soft
              reset (as done during the error  recovery  sequence).   Not  all
              drives support this feature.

       -L     Set  the drive's doorlock flag.  Setting this to 1 will lock the
              door mechanism of some removable  hard  drives  (e.g.,  Syquest,
              ZIP,  Jazz..),  and  setting it to 0 will unlock the door mecha-
              nism.  Normally, Linux maintains the door locking mechanism  au-
              tomatically,   depending  on  drive  usage  (locked  whenever  a
              filesystem is mounted).  But on system shutdown, this can  be  a
              nuisance if the root partition is on a removable disk, since the
              root partition is left mounted (read-only) after shutdown.   So,
              by using this command to unlock the door after the root filesys-
              tem is remounted read-only, one can then  remove  the  cartridge
              from the drive after shutdown.

       -m     Get/set  sector  count  for multiple sector I/O on the drive.  A
              setting of 0 disables this feature.  Multiple sector  mode  (aka
              IDE  Block  Mode),  is a feature of most modern IDE hard drives,
              permitting the transfer of multiple sectors per  I/O  interrupt,
              rather  than the usual one sector per interrupt.  When this fea-
              ture is enabled, it typically reduces operating system  overhead
              for  disk  I/O by 30-50%.  On many systems, it also provides in-
              creased data throughput  of  anywhere  from  5%  to  50%.   Some
              drives, however (most notably the WD Caviar series), seem to run
              slower with multiple mode enabled.  Your mileage may vary.  Most
              drives support the minimum settings of 2, 4, 8, or 16 (sectors).
              Larger settings may also be possible, depending on the drive.  A
              setting of 16 or 32 seems optimal on many systems.  Western Dig-
              ital recommends lower settings of  4  to  8  on  many  of  their
              drives,  due  tiny  (32  KiB)  drive  buffers  and non-optimized
              buffering algorithms.  The -i option can be  used  to  find  the
              maximum  setting  supported by an installed drive (look for Max-
              MultSect in the output).  Some drives claim to support  multiple
              mode, but lose data at some settings.  Under rare circumstances,
              such failures can result in massive filesystem corruption.

       --make-bad-sector
              Deliberately create a bad sector (aka.  "media  error")  on  the
              disk.   EXCEPTIONALLY  DANGEROUS. DO NOT USE THIS OPTION!!  This
              can be useful for testing of device/RAID error  recovery  mecha-
              nisms.  The sector number is given as a (base10) parameter after
              the option.  Depending on the device, hdparm will choose one  of
              two  possible  ATA  commands  for  corrupting  the  sector.  The
              WRITE_LONG works on most drives, but only up to the 28-bit  sec-
              tor  boundary.   Some  very recent drives (2008) may support the
              new WRITE_UNCORRECTABLE_EXT command, which works for  any  LBA48
              sector.   If  available,  hdparm  will use that in preference to
              WRITE_LONG.  The WRITE_UNCORRECTABLE_EXT command itself presents
              a  choice  of how the new bad sector should behave.  By default,
              it will look like any other bad sector, and the drive  may  take
              some  time  to retry and fail on subsequent READs of the sector.
              However, if a single letter f is prepended immediately in  front
              of  the  first digit of the sector number parameter, then hdparm
              will issue a "flagged" WRITE_UNCORRECTABLE_EXT, which causes the
              drive  to  merely  flag the sector as bad (rather than genuinely
              corrupt it), and subsequent READs of the sector will fail  imme-
              diately (rather than after several retries).  Note also that the
              --repair-sector option can be used to restore (any) bad  sectors
              when they are no longer needed, including sectors that were gen-
              uinely bad (the drive will likely remap those to a fresh area on
              the media).

       -M     Get/set Automatic Acoustic Management (AAM) setting. Most modern
              harddisk drives have the ability to speed down  the  head  move-
              ments to reduce their noise output.  The possible values are be-
              tween 0 and 254. 128 is the most quiet (and  therefore  slowest)
              setting and 254 the fastest (and loudest). Some drives have only
              two levels (quiet / fast), while others may have different  lev-
              els  between  128 and 254.  At the moment, most drives only sup-
              port 3 options, off, quiet, and fast.  These have been  assigned
              the values 0, 128, and 254 at present, respectively, but integer
              space has been incorporated for future  expansion,  should  this
              change.

       -n     Get or set the "ignore_write_errors" flag in the driver.  Do NOT
              play with this without grokking the driver source code first.

       -N     Get/set max visible number of sectors, also known  as  the  Host
              Protected  Area  setting.   Without a parameter, -N displays the
              current setting, which is reported  as  two  values:  the  first
              gives  the current max sectors setting, and the second shows the
              native (real) hardware limit for the disk.  The  difference  be-
              tween  these  two  values indicates how many sectors of the disk
              are currently hidden from the operating system, in the form of a
              Host  Protected Area (HPA).  This area is often used by computer
              makers to hold diagnostic software, and/or a copy of the  origi-
              nally  provided operating system for recovery purposes.  Another
              possible use is to hide the true capacity of a very  large  disk
              from a BIOS/system that cannot normally cope with drives of that
              size (e.g., most current {2010} BIOSs cannot  deal  with  drives
              larger  than 2 TB, so an HPA could be used to cause a 3 TB drive
              to report itself as a 2 TB drive).  To change  the  current  max
              (VERY  DANGEROUS,  DATA  LOSS  IS EXTREMELY LIKELY), a new value
              should be provided (in base10) immediately following the -N  op-
              tion.   This  value  is  specified as a count of sectors, rather
              than the "max sector address" of the  drive.   Drives  have  the
              concept  of  a temporary (volatile) setting which is lost on the
              next hardware reset, as well as a more permanent  (non-volatile)
              value  which  survives  resets and power cycles.  By default, -N
              affects only the temporary (volatile) setting.   To  change  the
              permanent  (non-volatile)  value,  prepend a leading p character
              immediately before the first digit of  the  value.   Drives  are
              supposed to allow only a single permanent change per session.  A
              hardware reset (or power cycle) is required before another  per-
              manent  -N  operation can succeed.  Note that any attempt to set
              this value may fail if the disk is being accessed by other soft-
              ware  at  the  same time.  This is because setting the value re-
              quires a pair of back-to-back drive commands, but  there  is  no
              way  to  prevent  some other command from being inserted between
              them by the kernel.  So if it fails initially, just  try  again.
              Kernel  support  for  -N  is buggy for many adapter types across
              many kernel versions, in that an incorrect (too small) max  size
              value is sometimes reported.  As of the 2.6.27 kernel, this does
              finally seem to be working on most hardware.

       --offset
              Offsets to given number of GiB (1024*1024*1024) when  performing
              -t  timings  of device reads.  Speed changes (about twice) along
              many mechanical drives.  Usually the maximum is  at  the  begin-
              ning,  but  not  always.   Solid-state drives (SSDs) should show
              similar timings regardless of offset.

       -p     Attempt to reprogram the IDE interface chipset for the specified
              PIO  mode,  or attempt to auto-tune for the "best" PIO mode sup-
              ported by the drive.  This feature is supported  in  the  kernel
              for  only  a  few "known" chipsets, and even then the support is
              iffy at best.  Some IDE chipsets are unable  to  alter  the  PIO
              mode for a single drive, in which case this option may cause the
              PIO mode for both drives to be set.  Many IDE  chipsets  support
              either  fewer  or more than the standard six (0 to 5) PIO modes,
              so the exact speed setting that  is  actually  implemented  will
              vary  by  chipset/driver  sophistication.  Use with extreme cau-
              tion!  This feature includes zero protection for the unwary, and
              an  unsuccessful outcome may result in severe filesystem corrup-
              tion!

       -P     Set the maximum sector count for the drive's  internal  prefetch
              mechanism.   Not  all  drives  support  this feature, and it was
              dropped from the official spec as of ATA-4.

       --prefer-ata12
              When using the SAT (SCSI ATA Translation) protocol, hdparm  nor-
              mally  prefers to use the 16-byte command format whenever possi-
              ble.  But some USB drive enclosures don't  work  correctly  with
              16-byte  commands.   This option can be used to force use of the
              smaller 12-byte command format with such  drives.   hdparm  will
              still  revert to 16-byte commands for things that cannot be done
              with the 12-byte format (e.g., sector accesses beyond 28-bits).

       -q     Handle the next option quietly, suppressing normal  output  (but
              not error messages).  This is useful for reducing screen clutter
              when running from system startup scripts.  Not applicable to the
              -i or -v or -t or -T options.

       -Q     Get or set the device's command queue_depth, if supported by the
              hardware.  This only works with 2.6.xx (or later)  kernels,  and
              only  with device and driver combinations which support changing
              the queue_depth.  For SATA disks, this  is  the  Native  Command
              Queuing (NCQ) queue depth.

       -r     Get/set  read-only  flag for the device.  When set, Linux disal-
              lows write operations on the device.

       -R     Get/set Write-Read-Verify feature, if  the  drive  supports  it.
              Usage:  -R0 (disable) or -R1 (enable).  This feature is intended
              to have the drive firmware automatically read-back any data that
              is written by software, to verify that the data was successfully
              written.  This is generally overkill, and  can  slow  down  disk
              writes by as much as a factor of two (or more).

       --read-sector
              Reads  from  the specified sector number, and dumps the contents
              in hex to standard output.  The  sector  number  must  be  given
              (base10)  after this option.  hdparm will issue a low-level read
              (completely bypassing the usual block  layer  read/write  mecha-
              nisms)  for  the  specified sector.  This can be used to defini-
              tively check whether a given sector is bad (media error) or  not
              (doing  so through the usual mechanisms can sometimes give false
              positives).

       --repair-sector
              This is an alias for the --write-sector option.  VERY DANGEROUS.

       -s     Enable/disable the power-on in standby feature, if supported  by
              the  drive.   VERY  DANGEROUS.   Do not use unless you are abso-
              lutely certain that both the system BIOS (or firmware)  and  the
              operating  system  kernel  (Linux >= 2.6.22) support probing for
              drives that use this feature.  When enabled, the drive  is  pow-
              ered-up  in the standby mode to allow the controller to sequence
              the spin-up of devices, reducing the instantaneous current  draw
              burden when many drives share a power supply.  Primarily for use
              in large RAID setups.  This feature is usually disabled and  the
              drive  is  powered-up  in  the active mode (see -C above).  Note
              that a drive may also allow enabling this feature by  a  jumper.
              Some  SATA  drives support the control of this feature by pin 11
              of the SATA power connector. In these cases, this command may be
              unsupported or may have no effect.

       -S     Put  the  drive  into  idle  (low-power)  mode, and also set the
              standby (spindown) timeout for the drive.  This timeout value is
              used  by  the  drive to determine how long to wait (with no disk
              activity) before turning off the spindle motor  to  save  power.
              Under  such circumstances, the drive may take as long as 30 sec-
              onds to respond to a subsequent disk access, though most  drives
              are much quicker.  The encoding of the timeout value is somewhat
              peculiar.  A value of zero means "timeouts  are  disabled":  the
              device will not automatically enter standby mode.  Values from 1
              to 240 specify multiples of 5 seconds, yielding timeouts from  5
              seconds to 20 minutes.  Values from 241 to 251 specify from 1 to
              11 units of 30 minutes, yielding timeouts from 30 minutes to 5.5
              hours.   A  value  of  252  signifies a timeout of 21 minutes. A
              value of 253 sets a vendor-defined timeout period between 8  and
              12  hours, and the value 254 is reserved.  255 is interpreted as
              21 minutes plus 15 seconds.  Note that  some  older  drives  may
              have very different interpretations of these values.

       --set-sector-size
              For  drives  which  support  reconfiguring of the Logical Sector
              Size, this flag can be used to specify the  new  desired  sector
              size  in  bytes.  VERY DANGEROUS. This most likely will scramble
              all data on the drive.  The specified size must be one  of  512,
              520,  528,  4096, 4160, or 4224.  Very few drives support values
              other than 512 and 4096.   Eg.   hdparm  --set-sector-size  4096
              /dev/sdb

       -t     Perform  timings  of  device  reads for benchmark and comparison
              purposes.  For meaningful results, this operation should be  re-
              peated  2-3  times on an otherwise inactive system (no other ac-
              tive processes) with at least a couple of megabytes of free mem-
              ory.   This  displays  the  speed  of reading through the buffer
              cache to the disk without any prior caching of data.  This  mea-
              surement  is an indication of how fast the drive can sustain se-
              quential data reads under Linux, without  any  filesystem  over-
              head.   To  ensure  accurate  measurements,  the buffer cache is
              flushed during the processing of -t using the BLKFLSBUF ioctl.

       -T     Perform timings of cache reads for benchmark and comparison pur-
              poses.   For  meaningful  results,  this operation should be re-
              peated 2-3 times on an otherwise inactive system (no  other  ac-
              tive processes) with at least a couple of megabytes of free mem-
              ory.  This displays the speed of reading directly from the Linux
              buffer  cache  without  disk access.  This measurement is essen-
              tially an indication of the throughput of the processor,  cache,
              and memory of the system under test.

       --trim-sector-ranges
              For  Solid State Drives (SSDs).  EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO NOT
              USE THIS OPTION!!  Tells the drive firmware to discard  unneeded
              data  sectors,  destroying  any  data that may have been present
              within them.  This makes those sectors available  for  immediate
              use  by  the firmware's garbage collection mechanism, to improve
              scheduling for wear-leveling of the flash  media.   This  option
              expects one or more sector range pairs immediately after the op-
              tion: an LBA starting address, a colon, and a sector count  (max
              65535), with no intervening spaces.  EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS. DO
              NOT USE THIS OPTION!!

              E.g., hdparm --trim-sector-ranges 1000:4 7894:16 /dev/sdz

       --trim-sector-ranges-stdin
              Identical to --trim-sector-ranges  above,  except  the  list  of
              lba:count  pairs  is read from stdin rather than being specified
              on the command line.  This can be used to  avoid  problems  with
              excessively  long  command  lines.   It also permits batching of
              many more sector ranges into single commands to the drive, up to
              the currently configured transfer limit (max_sectors_kb).

       -u     Get/set the interrupt-unmask flag for the drive.  A setting of 1
              permits the driver to unmask other interrupts during  processing
              of  a disk interrupt, which greatly improves Linux's responsive-
              ness and eliminates "serial port overrun" errors.  Use this fea-
              ture  with  caution:  some  drive/controller combinations do not
              tolerate the increased I/O latencies possible when this  feature
              is enabled, resulting in massive filesystem corruption.  In par-
              ticular, CMD-640B and RZ1000 (E)IDE interfaces can be unreliable
              (due  to  a  hardware flaw) when this option is used with kernel
              versions earlier than 2.0.13.  Disabling the IDE  prefetch  fea-
              ture  of these interfaces (usually a BIOS/CMOS setting) provides
              a safe fix for the problem for use with earlier kernels.

       -v     Display some basic settings, similar to -acdgkmur for IDE.  This
              is also the default behaviour when no options are specified.

       -V     Display program version and exit immediately.

       --verbose
              Display extra diagnostics from some commands.

       -w     Perform a device reset (DANGEROUS).  Do NOT use this option.  It
              exists for unlikely situations where a reboot might otherwise be
              required to get a confused drive back into a useable state.

       --write-sector
              Writes  zeros  to  the specified sector number.  VERY DANGEROUS.
              The sector number must be given (base10) after this option.  hd-
              parm  will  issue  a  low-level  write (completely bypassing the
              usual block layer read/write mechanisms) to the  specified  sec-
              tor.   This  can be used to force a drive to repair a bad sector
              (media error).

       -W     Get/set the IDE/SATA drive's write-caching feature.

       -X     Set the IDE transfer mode for (E)IDE/ATA drives.  This is  typi-
              cally  used  in combination with -d1 when enabling DMA to/from a
              drive on a supported interface chipset, where -X mdma2  is  used
              to  select multiword DMA mode2 transfers and -X sdma1 is used to
              select simple mode 1 DMA transfers.  With systems which  support
              UltraDMA  burst  timings,  -X  udma2  is used to select UltraDMA
              mode2 transfers (you'll need to prepare the chipset for UltraDMA
              beforehand).  Apart from that, use of this option is seldom nec-
              essary since most/all modern IDE drives default to their fastest
              PIO  transfer  mode at power-on.  Fiddling with this can be both
              needless and risky.  On drives which support alternate  transfer
              modes,  -X  can  be  used  to switch the mode of the drive only.
              Prior to changing the transfer mode, the IDE interface should be
              jumpered  or programmed (see -p option) for the new mode setting
              to prevent loss and/or corruption of data.  Use  this  with  ex-
              treme  caution!   For the PIO (Programmed Input/Output) transfer
              modes used by Linux, this value is simply the desired  PIO  mode
              number  plus  8.  Thus, a value of 09 sets PIO mode1, 10 enables
              PIO mode2, and 11 selects PIO mode3.  Setting  00  restores  the
              drive's  "default"  PIO mode, and 01 disables IORDY.  For multi-
              word DMA, the value used is the desired DMA mode number plus 32.
              for UltraDMA, the value is the desired UltraDMA mode number plus
              64.

       -y     Force an IDE drive to immediately enter the low  power  consump-
              tion standby mode, usually causing it to spin down.  The current
              power mode status can be checked using the -C option.

       -Y     Force an IDE drive to immediately enter the  lowest  power  con-
              sumption sleep mode, causing it to shut down completely.  A hard
              or soft reset is required before the drive can be accessed again
              (the  Linux IDE driver will automatically handle issuing a reset
              if/when needed).  The current power mode status can  be  checked
              using the -C option.

       -z     Force  a  kernel re-read of the partition table of the specified
              device(s).

       -Z     Disable the automatic power-saving function of  certain  Seagate
              drives  (ST3xxx  models?), to prevent them from idling/spinning-
              down at inconvenient times.

DESCRIPTION: w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

USAGE: w [options] [user]

OPTIONS:
-h, --no-header
              Don't print the header.

       -u, --no-current
              Ignores the username while figuring out the current process  and
              cpu times.  To demonstrate this, do a su and do a w and a w -u.

       -s, --short
              Use  the short format.  Don't print the login time, JCPU or PCPU
              times.

       -f, --from
              Toggle printing the from (remote hostname) field.   The  default
              as  released  is  for the from field to not be printed, although
              your system administrator or distribution  maintainer  may  have
              compiled a version in which the from field is shown by default.

       --help Display help text and exit.

       -i, --ip-addr
              Display IP address instead of hostname for from field.

       -V, --version

COMMAND: last

DESCRIPTION: last, lastb - show a listing of last logged in users

USAGE: last [options] [username...] [tty...]

       lastb [options] [username...] [tty...]

OPTIONS:
-a, --hostlast
           Display the hostname in the last column. Useful in combination with
           the --dns option.

       -d, --dns
           For non-local logins, Linux stores not only the host name of the
           remote host, but its IP number as well. This option translates the
           IP number back into a hostname.

       -f, --file file
           Tell last to use a specific file instead of /var/log/wtmp. The
           --file option can be given multiple times, and all of the specified
           files will be processed.

       -F, --fulltimes
           Print full login and logout times and dates.

       -i, --ip
           Like --dns , but displays the host's IP number instead of the name.

       -number; -n, --limit number
           Tell last how many lines to show.

       -p, --present time
           Display the users who were present at the specified time. This is
           like using the options --since and --until together with the same
           time.

       -R, --nohostname
           Suppresses the display of the hostname field.

       -s, --since time
           Display the state of logins since the specified time. This is
           useful, e.g., to easily determine who was logged in at a particular
           time. The option is often combined with --until.

       -t, --until time
           Display the state of logins until the specified time.

       --time-format format
           Define the output timestamp format to be one of notime, short,
           full, or iso. The notime variant will not print any timestamps at
           all, short is the default, and full is the same as the --fulltimes
           option. The iso variant will display the timestamp in ISO-8601
           format. The ISO format contains timezone information, making it
           preferable when printouts are investigated outside of the system.

       -w, --fullnames
           Display full user names and domain names in the output.

       -x, --system
           Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: lastlog

DESCRIPTION: lastlog - reports the most recent login of all users or of a given user

USAGE: lastlog [options]

OPTIONS:
The options which apply to the lastlog command are:

       -b, --before DAYS
           Print only lastlog records older than DAYS.

       -C, --clear
           Clear lastlog record of a user. This option can be used only
           together with -u (--user)).

       -h, --help
           Display help message and exit.

       -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
           Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration
           files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only absolute paths are
           supported.

       -S, --set
           Set lastlog record of a user to the current time. This option can
           be used only together with -u (--user)).

       -t, --time DAYS
           Print the lastlog records more recent than DAYS.

       -u, --user LOGIN|RANGE
           Print the lastlog record of the specified user(s).

           The users can be specified by a login name, a numerical user ID, or
           a RANGE of users. This RANGE of users can be specified with a min
           and max values (UID_MIN-UID_MAX), a max value (-UID_MAX), or a min
           value (UID_MIN-).

       If the user has never logged in the message ** Never logged in** will
       be displayed instead of the port and time.

       Only the entries for the current users of the system will be displayed.
       Other entries may exist for users that were deleted previously.

#      - MAIL_DIR defines the location of users mail spool files
#        (for mbox use) by appending the username to MAIL_DIR as defined
#        below.
#      - MAIL_FILE defines the location of the users mail spool files as the
#        fully-qualified filename obtained by prepending the user home
#        directory before $MAIL_FILE
#
# NOTE: This is no more used for setting up users MAIL environment variable
#       which is, starting from shadow 4.0.12-1 in Debian, entirely the
#       job of the pam_mail PAM modules
#       See default PAM configuration files provided for

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

                     such calls.

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,

              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-

       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: locate

DESCRIPTION: plocate - find files by name, quickly

USAGE: plocate [OPTION]...  PATTERN...

OPTIONS:
-A, --all
              Ignored for compatibility with mlocate(1).

       -b, --basename
              Match only against the file name portion of the path name,  ie.,
              the  directory  names will be excluded from the match (but still
              printed). This does not speed up the search,  but  can  suppress
              uninteresting matches.

       -c, --count
              Do  not  print  each match. Instead, count them, and print out a
              total number at the end.

       -d, --database DBPATH
              Find matches in the given  database,  instead  of  /var/lib/plo-
              cate/plocate.db.   This argument can be given multiple times, to
              search multiple databases.  It is also possible to give multiple
              databases  in one argument, separated by :.  (Any character, in-
              cluding : and \, can be escaped by prepending a \.)

       -e, --existing
              Print only entries that refer to files existing at the time  lo-
              cate  is run. Note that unlike mlocate(1), symlinks are not fol-
              lowed by default (and indeed,  there  is  no  option  to  change
              this).

       -i, --ignore-case
              Do  a case-insensitive match as given by the current locale (de-
              fault is case-sensitive, byte-by-byte match). Note that  plocate
              does  not  support the full range of Unicode case folding rules;
              in particular, searching for  will not give you  matches  on  ss
              even  in  a  German  locale.  Also note that this option will be
              somewhat slower than a case-sensitive match, since it  needs  to
              generate more candidates for searching the index.

       -l, --limit LIMIT
              Stop  searching  after LIMIT matches have been found. If --count
              is given, the number printed out will be at most LIMIT.

       -N, --literal
              Print entry names without quoting. Normally, plocate will escape
              special  characters in filenames, so that they are safe for con-
              sumption by typical shells (similar to the GNU coreutils  shell-
              escape-always  quoting  style),  unless  printing to a pipe, but
              this options will turn off such quoting.

       -0, --null
              Instead of writing a newline after  every  match,  write  a  NUL
              (ASCII  0).  This is useful for creating unambiguous output when
              it is to be processed by other tools (like xargs(1)),  as  file-
              names are allowed to contain embedded newlines.

       -r, --regexp
              Patterns  are  taken to be POSIX basic regular expressions.  See
              regex(7) for more information. Note that this  forces  a  linear
              scan through the entire database, which is slow.

       --regex
              Like  --regexp,  but  patterns are instead taken to be POSIX ex-
              tended regular expressions.

       -w, --wholename
              Match against the entire path name. This is the default, so  un-
              less  -b  is  given  first (see above), it will not do anything.
              This option thus exists only as compatibility with mlocate(1).

       --help Print out usage information, then exit successfully.

       --version
              Print out version information, then exit successfully.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

                     ceeded or failed.

              stat   Print  messages  as  files are examined with the stat and

                     such calls.

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed

                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

                     ceeded or failed.

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes

              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate suc-
                     ceeded or failed.

              search Navigate the directory tree verbosely.

              stat   Print  messages  as  files are examined with the stat and
                     lstat system calls.  The find program tries  to  minimise
                     such calls.

              tree   Show  the  expression  tree in its original and optimised
                     form.

              all    Enable all of the other debug options (but help).

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to

OPTIONS:
-V, -Version
              Print the version of the ip utility and exit.

       -h, -human, -human-readable
              output statistics with human readable values followed by suffix.

       -b, -batch <FILENAME>
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke
              them.  First failure will cause termination of ip.

       -force Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode.  If there were any
              errors during execution of the commands, the application return
              code will be non zero.

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              Output more information. If the option appears twice or more,
              the amount of information increases.  As a rule, the information
              is statistics or some time values.

       -d, -details
              Output more detailed information.

       -l, -loops <COUNT>
              Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic
              will attempt before giving up. The default is 10.  Zero (0)
              means loop until all addresses are removed.

       -f, -family <FAMILY>
              Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family iden-
              tifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link.  If this
              option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other
              arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough
              information to guess the family, ip falls back to the default
              one, usually inet or any.  link is a special family identifier
              meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

       -4     shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     shortcut for -family inet6.

       -B     shortcut for -family bridge.

       -M     shortcut for -family mpls.

       -0     shortcut for -family link.

       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with
              the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to count
              records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

       -r, -resolve
              use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of
              host addresses.

       -n, -netns <NETNS>
              switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually
              it just simplifies executing of:

              ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -N, -Numeric
              Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly in-
              stead of converting it to human readable name.

       -a, -all
              executes specified command over all objects, it depends if com-
              mand supports this option.

       -c[color][={always|auto|never}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color
              output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If parameter is
              auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color
              output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled. If
              specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence. This
              flag is ignored if -json is also given.

              Used color palette can be influenced by COLORFGBG environment
              variable (see ENVIRONMENT).

       -t, -timestamp
              display current time when using monitor option.

       -ts, -tshort
              Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

       -rc, -rcvbuf<SIZE>
              Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

       -iec   print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

       -br, -brief
              Print only basic information in a tabular format for better
              readability. This option is currently only supported by ip addr
              show , ip link show & ip neigh show commands.

       -j, -json
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       -p, -pretty
              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse
              but hard for most users to read.  This flag adds indentation for
              readability.

       -echo  Request the kernel to send the applied configuration back.

COMMAND: ifconfig

DESCRIPTION: ifconfig - configure a network interface

USAGE: ifconfig [-v] [-a] [-s] [interface]
       ifconfig [-v] interface [aftype] options | address ...

OPTIONS:
-a     display all interfaces which are currently  available,  even  if
              down

       -s     display a short list (like netstat -i)

       -v     be more verbose for some error conditions

       interface
              The  name  of the interface.  This is usually a driver name fol-
              lowed by a unit number, for example eth0 for the first  Ethernet
              interface.  If  your  kernel  supports alias interfaces, you can
              specify them with syntax like eth0:0  for  the  first  alias  of
              eth0.  You  can  use them to assign more addresses. To delete an
              alias interface use ifconfig eth0:0 down.  Note: for every scope
              (i.e. same net with address/netmask combination) all aliases are
              deleted, if you delete the first (primary).

       up     This flag causes the interface to be activated.  It  is  implic-
              itly  specified  if an address is assigned to the interface; you
              can suppress this behavior when using an alias interface by  ap-
              pending  an  -  to  the  alias (e.g.  eth0:0-).  It is also sup-
              pressed when using the IPv4 0.0.0.0 address as the  kernel  will
              use this to implicitly delete alias interfaces.

       down   This flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut down.

       [-]arp Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on this interface.

       [-]promisc
              Enable or disable the promiscuous mode of the interface.  If se-
              lected, all packets on the network will be received by  the  in-
              terface.

       [-]allmulti
              Enable  or  disable all-multicast mode.  If selected, all multi-
              cast packets on the network will be received by the interface.

       mtu N  This parameter sets the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an inter-
              face.

       dstaddr addr
              Set  the  remote  IP  address for a point-to-point link (such as
              PPP).  This keyword is now obsolete; use the pointopoint keyword
              instead.

       netmask addr
              Set the IP network mask for this interface.  This value defaults
              to the usual class A, B or C network mask (as derived  from  the
              interface IP address), but it can be set to any value.

       add addr/prefixlen
              Add an IPv6 address to an interface.

       del addr/prefixlen
              Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.

       tunnel ::aa.bb.cc.dd
              Create  a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the given
              destination.

       irq addr
              Set the interrupt line used by this device.  Not all devices can
              dynamically change their IRQ setting.

       io_addr addr
              Set the start address in I/O space for this device.

       mem_start addr
              Set  the  start  address  for shared memory used by this device.
              Only a few devices need this.

       media type
              Set the physical port or medium type to be used by  the  device.
              Not all devices can change this setting, and those that can vary
              in what values  they  support.   Typical  values  for  type  are
              10base2 (thin Ethernet), 10baseT (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet),
              AUI (external transceiver) and so on.  The special  medium  type
              of  auto can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the media.
              Again, not all drivers can do this.

       [-]broadcast [addr]
              If the address argument is given, set the protocol broadcast ad-
              dress  for  this  interface.   Otherwise,  set  (or  clear)  the
              IFF_BROADCAST flag for the interface.

       [-]pointopoint [addr]
              This keyword enables the point-to-point mode  of  an  interface,
              meaning  that  it is a direct link between two machines with no-
              body else listening on it.
              If the address argument is also given, set the protocol  address
              of  the  other  side of the link, just like the obsolete dstaddr
              keyword does.  Otherwise, set or clear the IFF_POINTOPOINT  flag
              for the interface.

       hw class address
              Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver
              supports this operation.  The keyword must be  followed  by  the
              name of the hardware class and the printable ASCII equivalent of
              the hardware address.  Hardware classes currently supported  in-
              clude  ether  (Ethernet),  ax25  (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet and netrom
              (AMPR NET/ROM).

       multicast
              Set the multicast flag on the interface. This  should  not  nor-
              mally  be  needed  as  the  drivers set the flag correctly them-
              selves.

       address
              The IP address to be assigned to this interface.

       txqueuelen length
              Set the length of the transmit queue of the device. It is useful
              to  set  this to small values for slower devices with a high la-
              tency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast  bulk  transfers  from
              disturbing interactive traffic like telnet too much.

       name newname
              Change the name of this interface to newname. The interface must
              be shut down first.

COMMAND: ip

DESCRIPTION: ip - show / manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels

USAGE: ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       ip [ -force ] -batch filename

       OBJECT := { link | address | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable
               | tunnel | tuntap | maddress | mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm
               | netns | l2tp | tcp_metrics | token | macsec | vrf | mptcp |
               ioam | stats }

       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -h[uman-readable] | -s[tatistics] |
               -d[etails] | -r[esolve] | -iec | -f[amily] { inet | inet6 |
               link } | -4 | -6 | -B | -0 | -l[oops] { maximum-addr-flush-at-

               -ts[hort] | -n[etns] name | -N[umeric] | -a[ll] | -c[olor] |
               -br[ief] | -j[son] | -p[retty] }

OPTIONS:
-V, -Version
              Print the version of the ip utility and exit.

       -h, -human, -human-readable
              output statistics with human readable values followed by suffix.

       -b, -batch <FILENAME>
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke
              them.  First failure will cause termination of ip.

       -force Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode.  If there were any
              errors during execution of the commands, the application return
              code will be non zero.

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              Output more information. If the option appears twice or more,
              the amount of information increases.  As a rule, the information
              is statistics or some time values.

       -d, -details
              Output more detailed information.

       -l, -loops <COUNT>
              Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic
              will attempt before giving up. The default is 10.  Zero (0)
              means loop until all addresses are removed.

       -f, -family <FAMILY>
              Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family iden-
              tifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link.  If this
              option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other
              arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough
              information to guess the family, ip falls back to the default
              one, usually inet or any.  link is a special family identifier
              meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

       -4     shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     shortcut for -family inet6.

       -B     shortcut for -family bridge.

       -M     shortcut for -family mpls.

       -0     shortcut for -family link.

       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with
              the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to count
              records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

       -r, -resolve
              use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of
              host addresses.

       -n, -netns <NETNS>
              switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually
              it just simplifies executing of:

              ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -N, -Numeric
              Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly in-
              stead of converting it to human readable name.

       -a, -all
              executes specified command over all objects, it depends if com-
              mand supports this option.

       -c[color][={always|auto|never}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color
              output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If parameter is
              auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color
              output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled. If
              specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence. This
              flag is ignored if -json is also given.

              Used color palette can be influenced by COLORFGBG environment
              variable (see ENVIRONMENT).

       -t, -timestamp
              display current time when using monitor option.

       -ts, -tshort
              Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

       -rc, -rcvbuf<SIZE>
              Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

       -iec   print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

       -br, -brief
              Print only basic information in a tabular format for better
              readability. This option is currently only supported by ip addr
              show , ip link show & ip neigh show commands.

       -j, -json
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       -p, -pretty
              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse
              but hard for most users to read.  This flag adds indentation for
              readability.

       -echo  Request the kernel to send the applied configuration back.

COMMAND: route

DESCRIPTION: route - show / manipulate the IP routing table

USAGE: route [-CFvnNee] [-A family |-4|-6]

       route  [-v] [-A family |-4|-6] add [-net|-host] target [netmask Nm] [gw
              Gw] [metric N] [mss M] [window W] [irtt I] [reject] [mod]  [dyn]
              [reinstate] [[dev] If]

       route  [-v] [-A family |-4|-6] del [-net|-host] target [gw Gw] [netmask
              Nm] [metric M] [[dev] If]

       route  [-V] [--version] [-h] [--help]

OPTIONS:
-A family
              use the specified address family (eg `inet'). Use  route  --help
              for  a  full list. You can use -6 as an alias for --inet6 and -4
              as an alias for -A inet

       -F     operate on the kernel's FIB (Forwarding Information Base)  rout-
              ing table.  This is the default.

       -C     operate on the kernel's routing cache.

       -v     select verbose operation.

       -n     show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic
              host names. This is useful if you are trying  to  determine  why
              the route to your nameserver has vanished.

       -e     use  netstat(8)-format  for  displaying  the routing table.  -ee
              will generate a very long line  with  all  parameters  from  the
              routing table.

       del    delete a route.

       add    add a new route.

       target the destination network or host. You can provide an addresses or
              symbolic network or host name. Optionally you can use /prefixlen
              notation instead of using the netmask option.

       -net   the target is a network.

       -host  the target is a host.

       netmask NM
              when adding a network route, the netmask to be used.

       gw GW  route packets via a gateway.
              NOTE:  The  specified gateway must be reachable first. This usu-
              ally means that you have to set up a static route to the gateway
              beforehand.  If you specify the address of one of your local in-
              terfaces, it will be used to decide about the interface to which
              the  packets should be routed to. This is a BSDism compatibility
              hack.

       metric M
              set the metric field in the routing table (used by routing  dae-
              mons) to M. If this option is not specified the metric for inet6
              (IPv6) address family defaults to '1', for inet  (IPv4)  it  de-
              faults  to  '0'.  You  should  always specify an explicit metric
              value to not rely on those defaults  -  they  also  differ  from
              iproute2.

       mss M  sets  MTU  (Maximum  Transmission Unit) of the route to M bytes.
              Note that the current implementation of the route  command  does
              not allow the option to set the Maximum Segment Size (MSS).

       window W
              set  the  TCP  window  size for connections over this route to W
              bytes. This is typically only used on AX.25  networks  and  with
              drivers unable to handle back to back frames.

       irtt I set  the initial round trip time (irtt) for TCP connections over
              this route to I milliseconds (1-12000). This is  typically  only
              used on AX.25 networks. If omitted the RFC 1122 default of 300ms
              is used.

       reject install a blocking route, which will force  a  route  lookup  to
              fail.   This is for example used to mask out networks before us-
              ing the default route. This is NOT for firewalling.

       mod, dyn, reinstate
              install a dynamic or modified route. These flags are  for  diag-
              nostic purposes, and are generally only set by routing daemons.

       dev If force  the  route to be associated with the specified device, as
              the kernel will otherwise try to determine the device on its own
              (by  checking already existing routes and device specifications,
              and where the route is added to). In most  normal  networks  you
              won't need this.

              If  dev  If is the last option on the command line, the word dev
              may be omitted, as it's the default. Otherwise the order of  the
              route modifiers (metric netmask gw dev) doesn't matter.

       useful information about unconfigured address families.

   --wide, -W
       Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is
       optional for now to not break existing scripts.

   --numeric, -n
       Show  numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host,
       port or user names.

   --numeric-hosts
       shows numerical host addresses but does not affect  the  resolution  of
       port or user names.

   --numeric-ports
       shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host
       or user names.

   --numeric-users
       shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host  or
       port names.

   --protocol=family, -A
       Specifies  the  address families (perhaps better described as low level
       protocols) for which connections are to be shown.  family  is  a  comma
       (',') separated list of address family keywords like inet, inet6, unix,
       ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and bluetooth.  This has the  same  ef-
       fect  as  using  the  --inet|-4,  --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25,
       --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.

       The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp proto-
       col sockets.

       The  address  family bluetooth (Iv4) includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol
       sockets.

   -c, --continuous
       This will cause netstat to print the selected information every  second
       continuously.

   -e, --extend
       Display  additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum de-
       tail.

   -o, --timers
       Include information related to networking timers.

   -p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket  belongs.   A
       hyphen is shown if the socket belongs to the kernel (e.g. a kernel ser-
       vice, or the process has exited but the socket hasn't finished  closing
       yet).

   -l, --listening
       Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)

   -a, --all
       Show  both  listening and non-listening sockets.  With the --interfaces
       option, show interfaces that are not up

   -F
       Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)

   -C
       Print routing information from the route cache.

       netstat {--version|-V}

       netstat {--help|-h}

       address_family_options:

       [-4|--inet]                    [-6|--inet6]                   [--proto-
       col={inet,inet6,unix,ipx,ax25,netrom,ddp,bluetooth, ... } ] [--unix|-x]
       [--inet|--ip|--tcpip]  [--ax25]  [--x25] [--rose] [--ash] [--bluetooth]
       [--ipx] [--netrom] [--ddp|--appletalk] [--econet|--ec]

OPTIONS:
--verbose, -v
       Tell  the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some
       useful information about unconfigured address families.

   --wide, -W
       Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is
       optional for now to not break existing scripts.

   --numeric, -n
       Show  numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host,
       port or user names.

   --numeric-hosts
       shows numerical host addresses but does not affect  the  resolution  of
       port or user names.

   --numeric-ports
       shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host
       or user names.

   --numeric-users
       shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host  or
       port names.

   --protocol=family, -A
       Specifies  the  address families (perhaps better described as low level
       protocols) for which connections are to be shown.  family  is  a  comma
       (',') separated list of address family keywords like inet, inet6, unix,
       ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and bluetooth.  This has the  same  ef-
       fect  as  using  the  --inet|-4,  --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25,
       --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.

       The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp proto-
       col sockets.

       The  address  family bluetooth (Iv4) includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol
       sockets.

   -c, --continuous
       This will cause netstat to print the selected information every  second
       continuously.

   -e, --extend
       Display  additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum de-
       tail.

   -o, --timers
       Include information related to networking timers.

   -p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket  belongs.   A
       hyphen is shown if the socket belongs to the kernel (e.g. a kernel ser-
       vice, or the process has exited but the socket hasn't finished  closing
       yet).

   -l, --listening
       Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)

   -a, --all
       Show  both  listening and non-listening sockets.  With the --interfaces
       option, show interfaces that are not up

   -F
       Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)

   -C
       Print routing information from the route cache.

       [--ipx] [--netrom] [--ddp|--appletalk] [--econet|--ec]

OPTIONS:
--verbose, -v
       Tell  the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some
       useful information about unconfigured address families.

   --wide, -W
       Do not truncate IP addresses by using output as wide as needed. This is
       optional for now to not break existing scripts.

   --numeric, -n
       Show  numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host,
       port or user names.

   --numeric-hosts
       shows numerical host addresses but does not affect  the  resolution  of
       port or user names.

   --numeric-ports
       shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host
       or user names.

   --numeric-users
       shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host  or
       port names.

   --protocol=family, -A
       Specifies  the  address families (perhaps better described as low level
       protocols) for which connections are to be shown.  family  is  a  comma
       (',') separated list of address family keywords like inet, inet6, unix,
       ipx, ax25, netrom, econet, ddp, and bluetooth.  This has the  same  ef-
       fect  as  using  the  --inet|-4,  --inet6|-6, --unix|-x, --ipx, --ax25,
       --netrom, --ddp, and --bluetooth options.

       The address family inet (Iv4) includes raw, udp, udplite and tcp proto-
       col sockets.

       The  address  family bluetooth (Iv4) includes l2cap and rfcomm protocol
       sockets.

   -c, --continuous
       This will cause netstat to print the selected information every  second
       continuously.

   -e, --extend
       Display  additional information.  Use this option twice for maximum de-
       tail.

   -o, --timers
       Include information related to networking timers.

   -p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket  belongs.   A
       hyphen is shown if the socket belongs to the kernel (e.g. a kernel ser-
       vice, or the process has exited but the socket hasn't finished  closing
       yet).

   -l, --listening
       Show only listening sockets.  (These are omitted by default.)

   -a, --all
       Show  both  listening and non-listening sockets.  With the --interfaces
       option, show interfaces that are not up

   -F
       Print routing information from the FIB.  (This is the default.)

   -C
       Print routing information from the route cache.

              tclass IPv6 Traffic Class byte

              class_id
                     Class id set by net_cls cgroup. If  class  is  zero  this
                     shows priority set by SO_PRIORITY.

       --cgroup
              Show cgroup information. Below fields may appear:

              cgroup Cgroup  v2  pathname.  This  pathname  is relative to the
                     mount point of the hierarchy.

       --tipcinfo
              Show internal tipc socket information.

              -K, --kill
                     Attempts to forcibly close sockets. This option  displays
                     sockets  that  are successfully closed and silently skips
                     sockets that the kernel does not support closing. It sup-
                     ports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets only.

              -s, --summary
                     Print  summary  statistics.  This  option  does not parse
                     socket lists obtaining summary from various  sources.  It
                     is  useful when amount of sockets is so huge that parsing
                     /proc/net/tcp is painful.

              -E, --events
                     Continually display sockets as they are destroyed

              -Z, --context
                     As the -p option but also shows process security context.
                     If the -T option is used, also shows thread security con-
                     text.

                     For netlink(7) sockets the initiating process context  is
                     displayed as follows:

                            1.  If valid pid show the process context.

                            2.  If destination is kernel (pid = 0) show kernel
                                initial context.

                            3.  If a unique identifier has been  allocated  by
                                the  kernel  or  netlink user, show context as
                                "unavailable". This  will  generally  indicate
                                that  a  process  has  more  than  one netlink
                                socket active.

              -z, --contexts
                     As the -Z option but also shows the socket  context.  The
                     socket  context is taken from the associated inode and is
                     not the actual socket context held by the kernel. Sockets
                     are  typically  labeled  with the context of the creating
                     process, however the context shown will reflect any  pol-
                     icy role, type and/or range transition rules applied, and
                     is therefore a useful reference.

              -N NSNAME, --net=NSNAME
                     Switch to the specified network namespace name.

              -b, --bpf
                     Show socket classic BPF filters (only administrators  are
                     allowed to get these information).

              -4, --ipv4
                     Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).

              -6, --ipv6
                     Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

              -0, --packet
                     Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

              -t, --tcp
                     Display TCP sockets.

              -u, --udp
                     Display UDP sockets.

              -d, --dccp
                     Display DCCP sockets.

              -w, --raw
                     Display RAW sockets.

              -x, --unix
                     Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

              -S, --sctp
                     Display SCTP sockets.

              --tipc Display tipc sockets (alias for -f tipc).

              --vsock
                     Display vsock sockets (alias for -f vsock).

              --xdp  Display XDP sockets (alias for -f xdp).

              -M, --mptcp
                     Display MPTCP sockets.

              --inet-sockopt
                     Display inet socket options.

              -f FAMILY, --family=FAMILY
                     Display  sockets of type FAMILY.  Currently the following
                     families are supported: unix, inet, inet6, link, netlink,
                     vsock, tipc, xdp.

              -A QUERY, --query=QUERY, --socket=QUERY
                     List  of  socket tables to dump, separated by commas. The
                     following identifiers are  understood:  all,  inet,  tcp,
                     udp, raw, unix, packet, netlink, unix_dgram, unix_stream,
                     unix_seqpacket,  packet_raw,  packet_dgram,  dccp,  sctp,
                     tipc,  vsock_stream, vsock_dgram, xdp, mptcp. Any item in
                     the list may optionally be  prefixed  by  an  exclamation
                     mark (!)  to exclude that socket table from being dumped.

              -D FILE, --diag=FILE
                     Do  not display anything, just dump raw information about
                     TCP sockets to FILE after applying filters. If FILE is  -
                     stdout is used.

              -F FILE, --filter=FILE
                     Read  filter information from FILE.  Each line of FILE is
                     interpreted like single command line option. If FILE is -
                     stdin is used.

              FILTER := [ state STATE-FILTER ] [ EXPRESSION ]
                     Please  take a look at the official documentation for de-
                     tails regarding filters.

COMMAND: ss

DESCRIPTION: ss - another utility to investigate sockets

USAGE: ss [options] [ FILTER ]

OPTIONS:
When no option is used ss displays a list of open non-listening sockets
       (e.g. TCP/UNIX/UDP) that have established connection.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Output version information.

       -H, --no-header
              Suppress header line.

       -O, --oneline
              Print each socket's data on a single line.

       -n, --numeric
              Do not try to resolve service names. Show exact  bandwidth  val-
              ues, instead of human-readable.

       -r, --resolve
              Try to resolve numeric address/ports.

       -a, --all
              Display both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means es-
              tablished connections) sockets.

       -l, --listening
              Display only listening sockets (these are omitted by default).

       -o, --options
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(<timer_name>,<expire_time>,<retrans>)

              <timer_name>
                     the name of the timer,  there  are  five  kind  of  timer
                     names:

                     on  :  means  one of these timers: TCP retrans timer, TCP
                     early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers

              <expire_time>
                     how long time the timer will expire

              <retrans>
                     how many times the retransmission occurred

       -e, --extended
              Show detailed socket information. The output format is:

              uid:<uid_number> ino:<inode_number> sk:<cookie>

              <uid_number>
                     the user id the socket belongs to

              <inode_number>
                     the socket's inode number in VFS

              <cookie>
                     an uuid of the socket

       -m, --memory
              Show socket memory usage. The output format is:

              skmem:(r<rmem_alloc>,rb<rcv_buf>,t<wmem_alloc>,tb<snd_buf>,
                            f<fwd_alloc>,w<wmem_queued>,o<opt_mem>,
                            bl<back_log>,d<sock_drop>)

              <rmem_alloc>
                     the memory allocated for receiving packet

              <rcv_buf>
                     the total memory can be allocated for receiving packet

              <wmem_alloc>
                     the memory used for sending packet (which has  been  sent
                     to layer 3)

              <snd_buf>

              <fwd_alloc>
                     the memory allocated by the socket as cache, but not used
                     for receiving/sending  packet  yet.  If  need  memory  to
                     send/receive  packet,  the  memory  in this cache will be
                     used before allocate additional memory.

              <wmem_queued>
                     The memory allocated for sending packet  (which  has  not
                     been sent to layer 3)

              <opt_mem>

                     context,  if  the  process is receiving packet, and a new
                     packet is received, it will be put into  the  sk  backlog
                     queue, so it can be received by the process immediately

              <sock_drop>
                     the  number  of packets dropped before they are de-multi-

              tclass IPv6 Traffic Class byte

              class_id
                     Class id set by net_cls cgroup. If  class  is  zero  this
                     shows priority set by SO_PRIORITY.

       --cgroup
              Show cgroup information. Below fields may appear:

              cgroup Cgroup  v2  pathname.  This  pathname  is relative to the
                     mount point of the hierarchy.

       --tipcinfo
              Show internal tipc socket information.

              -K, --kill
                     Attempts to forcibly close sockets. This option  displays
                     sockets  that  are successfully closed and silently skips
                     sockets that the kernel does not support closing. It sup-
                     ports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets only.

              -s, --summary
                     Print  summary  statistics.  This  option  does not parse
                     socket lists obtaining summary from various  sources.  It
                     is  useful when amount of sockets is so huge that parsing
                     /proc/net/tcp is painful.

              -E, --events
                     Continually display sockets as they are destroyed

              -Z, --context
                     As the -p option but also shows process security context.
                     If the -T option is used, also shows thread security con-
                     text.

                     For netlink(7) sockets the initiating process context  is
                     displayed as follows:

                            1.  If valid pid show the process context.

                            2.  If destination is kernel (pid = 0) show kernel
                                initial context.

                            3.  If a unique identifier has been  allocated  by
                                the  kernel  or  netlink user, show context as
                                "unavailable". This  will  generally  indicate
                                that  a  process  has  more  than  one netlink
                                socket active.

              -z, --contexts
                     As the -Z option but also shows the socket  context.  The
                     socket  context is taken from the associated inode and is
                     not the actual socket context held by the kernel. Sockets
                     are  typically  labeled  with the context of the creating
                     process, however the context shown will reflect any  pol-
                     icy role, type and/or range transition rules applied, and
                     is therefore a useful reference.

              -N NSNAME, --net=NSNAME
                     Switch to the specified network namespace name.

              -b, --bpf
                     Show socket classic BPF filters (only administrators  are
                     allowed to get these information).

              -4, --ipv4
                     Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).

              -6, --ipv6
                     Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

              -0, --packet
                     Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

              -t, --tcp
                     Display TCP sockets.

              -u, --udp
                     Display UDP sockets.

              -d, --dccp
                     Display DCCP sockets.

              -w, --raw
                     Display RAW sockets.

              -x, --unix
                     Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

              -S, --sctp
                     Display SCTP sockets.

              --tipc Display tipc sockets (alias for -f tipc).

              --vsock
                     Display vsock sockets (alias for -f vsock).

              --xdp  Display XDP sockets (alias for -f xdp).

              -M, --mptcp
                     Display MPTCP sockets.

              --inet-sockopt
                     Display inet socket options.

              -f FAMILY, --family=FAMILY
                     Display  sockets of type FAMILY.  Currently the following
                     families are supported: unix, inet, inet6, link, netlink,
                     vsock, tipc, xdp.

              -A QUERY, --query=QUERY, --socket=QUERY
                     List  of  socket tables to dump, separated by commas. The
                     following identifiers are  understood:  all,  inet,  tcp,
                     udp, raw, unix, packet, netlink, unix_dgram, unix_stream,
                     unix_seqpacket,  packet_raw,  packet_dgram,  dccp,  sctp,
                     tipc,  vsock_stream, vsock_dgram, xdp, mptcp. Any item in
                     the list may optionally be  prefixed  by  an  exclamation
                     mark (!)  to exclude that socket table from being dumped.

              -D FILE, --diag=FILE
                     Do  not display anything, just dump raw information about
                     TCP sockets to FILE after applying filters. If FILE is  -
                     stdout is used.

              -F FILE, --filter=FILE
                     Read  filter information from FILE.  Each line of FILE is
                     interpreted like single command line option. If FILE is -
                     stdin is used.

              FILTER := [ state STATE-FILTER ] [ EXPRESSION ]
                     Please  take a look at the official documentation for de-
                     tails regarding filters.

COMMAND: ss

DESCRIPTION: ss - another utility to investigate sockets

USAGE: ss [options] [ FILTER ]

OPTIONS:
When no option is used ss displays a list of open non-listening sockets
       (e.g. TCP/UNIX/UDP) that have established connection.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Output version information.

       -H, --no-header
              Suppress header line.

       -O, --oneline
              Print each socket's data on a single line.

       -n, --numeric
              Do not try to resolve service names. Show exact  bandwidth  val-
              ues, instead of human-readable.

       -r, --resolve
              Try to resolve numeric address/ports.

       -a, --all
              Display both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means es-
              tablished connections) sockets.

       -l, --listening
              Display only listening sockets (these are omitted by default).

       -o, --options
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(<timer_name>,<expire_time>,<retrans>)

              <timer_name>
                     the name of the timer,  there  are  five  kind  of  timer
                     names:

                     on  :  means  one of these timers: TCP retrans timer, TCP
                     early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers

              <expire_time>
                     how long time the timer will expire

              <retrans>
                     how many times the retransmission occurred

       -e, --extended
              Show detailed socket information. The output format is:

              uid:<uid_number> ino:<inode_number> sk:<cookie>

              <uid_number>
                     the user id the socket belongs to

              <inode_number>
                     the socket's inode number in VFS

              <cookie>

                     the memory allocated by the socket as cache, but not used
                     for receiving/sending  packet  yet.  If  need  memory  to
                     send/receive  packet,  the  memory  in this cache will be
                     used before allocate additional memory.

              <wmem_queued>
                     The memory allocated for sending packet  (which  has  not

                     context,  if  the  process is receiving packet, and a new
                     packet is received, it will be put into  the  sk  backlog
                     queue, so it can be received by the process immediately

              <sock_drop>
                     the  number  of packets dropped before they are de-multi-

                     MPTCP subflow information

       --tos  Show ToS and priority information. Below fields may appear:

              tos    IPv4 Type-of-Service byte

              tclass IPv6 Traffic Class byte

              class_id
                     Class id set by net_cls cgroup. If  class  is  zero  this
                     shows priority set by SO_PRIORITY.

       --cgroup
              Show cgroup information. Below fields may appear:

              cgroup Cgroup  v2  pathname.  This  pathname  is relative to the
                     mount point of the hierarchy.

       --tipcinfo
              Show internal tipc socket information.

              -K, --kill
                     Attempts to forcibly close sockets. This option  displays
                     sockets  that  are successfully closed and silently skips
                     sockets that the kernel does not support closing. It sup-
                     ports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets only.

              -s, --summary
                     Print  summary  statistics.  This  option  does not parse
                     socket lists obtaining summary from various  sources.  It
                     is  useful when amount of sockets is so huge that parsing
                     /proc/net/tcp is painful.

              -E, --events
                     Continually display sockets as they are destroyed

              -Z, --context
                     As the -p option but also shows process security context.
                     If the -T option is used, also shows thread security con-
                     text.

                     For netlink(7) sockets the initiating process context  is
                     displayed as follows:

                            1.  If valid pid show the process context.

                            2.  If destination is kernel (pid = 0) show kernel
                                initial context.

                            3.  If a unique identifier has been  allocated  by
                                the  kernel  or  netlink user, show context as
                                "unavailable". This  will  generally  indicate
                                that  a  process  has  more  than  one netlink
                                socket active.

              -z, --contexts
                     As the -Z option but also shows the socket  context.  The
                     socket  context is taken from the associated inode and is
                     not the actual socket context held by the kernel. Sockets
                     are  typically  labeled  with the context of the creating
                     process, however the context shown will reflect any  pol-
                     icy role, type and/or range transition rules applied, and
                     is therefore a useful reference.

              -N NSNAME, --net=NSNAME
                     Switch to the specified network namespace name.

              -b, --bpf
                     Show socket classic BPF filters (only administrators  are
                     allowed to get these information).

              -4, --ipv4
                     Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).

              -6, --ipv6
                     Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

              -0, --packet
                     Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

              -t, --tcp
                     Display TCP sockets.

              -u, --udp
                     Display UDP sockets.

              -d, --dccp
                     Display DCCP sockets.

              -w, --raw
                     Display RAW sockets.

              -x, --unix
                     Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

              -S, --sctp
                     Display SCTP sockets.

              --tipc Display tipc sockets (alias for -f tipc).

              --vsock
                     Display vsock sockets (alias for -f vsock).

              --xdp  Display XDP sockets (alias for -f xdp).

              -M, --mptcp
                     Display MPTCP sockets.

              --inet-sockopt
                     Display inet socket options.

              -f FAMILY, --family=FAMILY
                     Display  sockets of type FAMILY.  Currently the following
                     families are supported: unix, inet, inet6, link, netlink,
                     vsock, tipc, xdp.

              -A QUERY, --query=QUERY, --socket=QUERY
                     List  of  socket tables to dump, separated by commas. The
                     following identifiers are  understood:  all,  inet,  tcp,
                     udp, raw, unix, packet, netlink, unix_dgram, unix_stream,
                     unix_seqpacket,  packet_raw,  packet_dgram,  dccp,  sctp,
                     tipc,  vsock_stream, vsock_dgram, xdp, mptcp. Any item in
                     the list may optionally be  prefixed  by  an  exclamation
                     mark (!)  to exclude that socket table from being dumped.

              -D FILE, --diag=FILE
                     Do  not display anything, just dump raw information about
                     TCP sockets to FILE after applying filters. If FILE is  -
                     stdout is used.

              -F FILE, --filter=FILE
                     Read  filter information from FILE.  Each line of FILE is
                     interpreted like single command line option. If FILE is -
                     stdin is used.

              FILTER := [ state STATE-FILTER ] [ EXPRESSION ]
                     Please  take a look at the official documentation for de-
                     tails regarding filters.

COMMAND: lsof

DESCRIPTION: lsof - list open files

USAGE: lsof  [  -?abChlnNOPQRtUvVX  ]  [ -A A ] [ -c c ] [ +c c ] [ +|-d d ] [
       +|-D D ] [ +|-e s ] [ +|-E ] [ +|-f [cfgGn] ] [ -F [f] ] [ -g [s]  ]  [
       -i  [i] ] [ -k k ] [ -K k ] [ +|-L [l] ] [ +|-m m ] [ +|-M ] [ -o [o] ]
       [ -p s ] [ +|-r [t[m<fmt>]] ] [ -s [p:s] ] [ -S [t] ] [ -T [t] ] [ -u s
       ] [ +|-w ] [ -x [fl] ] [ -z [z] ] [ -Z [Z] ] [ -- ] [names]

OPTIONS:
In the absence of any options, lsof lists all open files  belonging  to
       all active processes.

       If  any  list  request option is specified, other list requests must be
       specifically requested - e.g., if -U is specified for  the  listing  of
       UNIX  socket  files, NFS files won't be listed unless -N is also speci-
       fied; or if a user list is specified with the -u  option,  UNIX  domain
       socket  files,  belonging to users not in the list, won't be listed un-
       less the -U option is also specified.

       Normally, list options that are specifically stated are  ORed  -  i.e.,
       specifying  the  -i option without an address and the -ufoo option pro-
       duces a listing of all network files OR files  belonging  to  processes
       owned by user ``foo''.  The exceptions are:

       1) the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the -u
          option;

       2) the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the -p option;

       3) the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the -g op-
          tion;

       4) the `^' (negated) command, specified with the -c option;

       5) the  (`^')  negated  TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with
          the -s [p:s] option.

       Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or AND-
       ing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.

       The -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example, specify-
       ing -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that
       belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.

       Caution:  the  -a option causes all list selection options to be ANDed;
       it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options
       by  placing it between them, even though its placement there is accept-
       able.  Wherever -a is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection op-
       tions.

       Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, net-
       work addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names,  se-
       curity  contexts  -  are joined in a single ORed set and applied before
       the result participates  in  ANDing.   Thus,  for  example,  specifying
       -i@aaa.bbb,  -i@ccc.ddd,  -a,  and -ufff,ggg will select the listing of
       files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND  have  network
       connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.

       Options  may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the
       option set ``-a -b -C'' may be stated as -abC.  However,  since  values
       are optional following +|-f, -F, -g, -i, +|-L, -o, +|-r, -s, -S, -T, -x
       and -z.  when you have no values for them be careful that the following
       character isn't ambiguous.  For example, -Fn might represent the -F and
       -n options, or it might represent the n field identifier character fol-
       lowing  the  -F option.  When ambiguity is possible, start a new option
       with a `-' character - e.g., ``-F -n''.  If the next option is  a  file
       name,  follow the possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g., ``-F --
       name''.

       Either the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of  options.
       Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., -i
       - may be grouped under either prefix.  Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may
       be  stated  as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate op-
       tions.  Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options  in  the
       group  does  take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g.,
       +|-M; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''.  When in doubt, use
       separate options with appropriate prefixes.

       -? -h    These  two  equivalent  options  select  a usage (help) output
                list.  Lsof displays a shortened form of this output  when  it
                detects  an  error in the options supplied to it, after it has
                displayed messages explaining each  error.   (Escape  the  `?'
                character as your shell requires.)

       -a       causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.

       -A A     is  available  on  systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel
                code is implemented via dynamic modules.  It allows  the  lsof
                user  to  specify  A  as an alternate name list file where the
                kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be  found.   See
                the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more
                information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they
                affect lsof.

       -b       causes  lsof  to  avoid  kernel  functions  that might block -
                lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).

                See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING  KERNEL  BLOCKS  sec-
                tions for information on using this option.

       -c c     selects  the listing of files for processes executing the com-
                mand that begins with the characters of c.  Multiple  commands
                may  be specified, using multiple -c options.  They are joined
                in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selec-
                tion.

                If  c begins with a `^', then the following characters specify
                a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)

                If c begins and ends with a slash ('/'),  the  characters  be-
                tween  the  slashes  are  interpreted as a regular expression.
                Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted
                to  prevent  their  interpretation  by the shell.  The closing
                slash may be followed by these modifiers:

                     b    the regular expression is a basic one.
                     i    ignore the case of letters.
                     x    the regular expression is an extended one
                          (default).

                See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives  its  location.)   for
                more information on basic and extended regular expressions.

                The  simple  command  specification  is tested first.  If that
                test fails, the command regular expression is applied.  If the
                simple  command  test succeeds, the command regular expression
                test isn't made.  This may result in ``no  command  found  for
                regex:'' messages when lsof's -V option is specified.

       +c w     defines  the maximum number of initial characters of the name,
                supplied by the UNIX dialect, of the UNIX  command  associated
                with a process to be printed in the COMMAND column.  (The lsof
                default is nine.)

                Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply  all  command  name
                characters to lsof in the files and structures from which lsof
                obtains command name.  Often  dialects  limit  the  number  of
                characters  supplied  in  those  sources.   For example, Linux
                2.4.27 and Solaris 9 both limit  command  name  length  to  16
                characters.

                If w is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to lsof by
                the UNIX dialect will be printed.

                If w is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'',
                it will be raised to that length.

       -C       disables  the  reporting  of any path name components from the
                kernel's name cache.  See the KERNEL NAME  CACHE  section  for
                more information.

       +d s     causes  lsof  to  search for all open instances of directory s
                and the files and directories it contains at  its  top  level.
                +d does NOT descend the directory tree, rooted at s.  The +D D
                option may be used to request a  full-descent  directory  tree
                search, rooted at directory D.

                Processing  of  the  +d  option does not follow symbolic links
                within s unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor
                does  it  search for open files on file system mount points on
                subdirectories of s unless the -x or  -x   f  option  is  also
                specified.

                Note:  the  authority  of the user of this option limits it to
                searching for files that the user has  permission  to  examine
                with the system stat(2) function.

       -d s     specifies  a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or
                include in the output listing.  The file descriptors are spec-
                ified  in  the  comma-separated  set  s  -  e.g., ``cwd,1,3'',
                ``^6,^2''.  (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set  begin
                with  `^'.   It  is  an inclusion list if no entry begins with
                `^'.  Mixed lists are not permitted.

                A file descriptor number range may be in the set  as  long  as
                neither  member  is  empty,  both members are numbers, and the
                ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g.,  ``0-7''
                or  ``3-10''.   Ranges  may be specified for exclusion if they
                have the `^' prefix - e.g., ``^0-7''  excludes  all  file  de-
                scriptors 0 through 7.

                Multiple  file  descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed
                set before participating in AND option selection.

                When there are exclusion and inclusion  members  in  the  set,
                lsof  reports  them as errors and exits with a non-zero return
                code.

                See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output  values  in
                the  OUTPUT  section  for  more information on file descriptor
                names.

                fd is a pseudo file descriptor name for specifying  the  whole
                range of possible file descriptor numbers.  fd does not appear
                in FD column of output.

       +D D     causes lsof to search for all open instances  of  directory  D
                and  all the files and directories it contains to its complete
                depth.

                Processing of the +D option does  not  follow  symbolic  links
                within D unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor
                does it search for open files on file system mount  points  on
                subdirectories  of  D  unless  the  -x or -x  f option is also
                specified.

                Note: the authority of the user of this option  limits  it  to
                searching  for  files  that the user has permission to examine
                with the system stat(2) function.

                Further note: lsof may process this option slowly and  require
                a large amount of dynamic memory to do it.  This is because it
                must descend the entire directory tree, rooted at  D,  calling
                stat(2)  for  each  file and directory, building a list of all
                the files it finds, and searching that list for a  match  with
                every  open  file.  When directory D is large, these steps can
                take a long time, so use this option prudently.

       -D D     directs lsof's use of the device cache file.  The use of  this
                option  is  sometimes  restricted.   See the DEVICE CACHE FILE
                section and the sections that follow it for  more  information
                on this option.

                -D  must be followed by a function letter; the function letter
                may optionally be followed by a path  name.   Lsof  recognizes
                these function letters:

                     ? - report device cache file paths
                     b - build the device cache file
                     i - ignore the device cache file
                     r - read the device cache file
                     u - read and update the device cache file

                The  b,  r,  and  u functions, accompanied by a path name, are
                sometimes restricted.  When these  functions  are  restricted,
                they  will not appear in the description of the -D option that
                accompanies -h or -?  option output.   See  the  DEVICE  CACHE
                FILE section and the sections that follow it for more informa-
                tion on these functions and when they're restricted.

                The ?  function reports the read-only  and  write  paths  that
                lsof can use for the device cache file, the names of any envi-
                ronment variables whose values lsof will examine when  forming
                the  device  cache  file path, and the format for the personal
                device cache file path.  (Escape the  `?'  character  as  your
                shell requires.)

                When  available,  the b, r, and u functions may be followed by
                the  device  cache  file's  path.   The  standard  default  is
                .lsof_hostname  in the home directory of the real user ID that
                executes lsof, but this could have been changed when lsof  was
                configured  and  compiled.   (The output of the -h and -?  op-
                tions show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.)  The
                suffix,  hostname,  is  the first component of the host's name
                returned by gethostname(2).

                When available, the b function directs lsof to build a new de-
                vice cache file at the default or specified path.

                The i function directs lsof to ignore the default device cache
                file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls
                to the kernel.

                The  r  function  directs lsof to read the device cache at the
                default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new
                device  cache file when none exists or the existing one is im-
                properly structured.  The r function, when specified without a
                path  name,  prevents  lsof from updating an incorrect or out-
                dated device cache file, or creating a new one in  its  place.
                The  r function is always available when it is specified with-
                out a path name argument; it may be restricted by the  permis-
                sions of the lsof process.

                When available, the u function directs lsof to read the device
                cache file at the default or specified path, if possible,  and
                to rebuild it, if necessary.  This is the default device cache
                file function when no -D option has been specified.

       +|-e s   exempts the file system whose path name is s from  being  sub-
                jected  to kernel function calls that might block.  The +e op-
                tion exempts stat(2), lstat(2)  and  most  readlink(2)  kernel
                function  calls.   The  -e  option  exempts  only  stat(2) and
                lstat(2) kernel function calls.  Multiple file systems may  be
                specified  with separate +|-e specifications and each may have
                readlink(2) calls exempted or not.

                This option is currently implemented only for Linux.

                CAUTION: this option can easily be mis-applied to  other  than
                the  file system of interest, because it uses path name rather
                than the more reliable device and inode numbers.  (Device  and
                inode  numbers  are  acquired  via  the  potentially  blocking
                stat(2) kernel call and are thus not available,  but  see  the
                +|-m  m  option as a possible alternative way to supply device
                numbers.)  Use this option with great care and  fully  specify
                the path name of the file system to be exempted.

                When  open files on exempted file systems are reported, it may
                not be possible to obtain all their  information.   Therefore,
                some   information  columns  will  be  blank,  the  characters
                ``UNKN'' preface the values in the TYPE column, and the appli-
                cable  exemption  option is added in parentheses to the end of
                the NAME column.  (Some device  number  information  might  be
                made available via the +|-m m option.)

       +|-E     +E specifies that Linux pipe, Linux UNIX socket, Linux INET(6)
                socket closed in a local  host,  Linux  pseudoterminal  files,
                POSIX  Message  Queueue  implementation  in  Linux,  and Linux
                eventfd should be displayed with endpoint information and  the
                files of the endpoints should also be displayed.

                Note  1:  UNIX socket file endpoint information is only avail-
                able when the compile flags line of -v output contains  HASUX-
                SOCKEPT, and psudoterminal endpoint information is only avail-
                able when the compile flags line contains HASPTYEPT.

                Note 2: POSIX Message Queue file endpoint information is  only
                available when mqueue file system is mounted.

                Pipe  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME column in
                the form ``PID,cmd,FDmode'', where PID is the endpoint process
                ID;  cmd  is  the endpoint process command; FD is the endpoint
                file's descriptor; and mode  is  the  endpoint  file's  access
                mode.

                Pseudoterminal  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME
                column as  ``->/dev/ptsmin PID,cmd,FDmode''  or  ``PID,cmd,FD-
                mode''.   The  first  form is for a master device; the second,
                for a slave device.  min is a slave device's minor device num-
                ber;  and PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe end-
                point information.  Note: psudoterminal  endpoint  information
                is  only  available  when  the compile flags line of -V output
                contains HASPTYEPT. In addition, this feature works  on  Linux
                kernels above 4.13.0.

                UNIX socket file endpoint information is displayed in the NAME
                column in the form
                ``type=TYPE ->INO=INODE PID,cmd,FDmode'', where  TYPE  is  the
                socket  type;  INODE  is  the  i-node  number of the connected
                socket; and PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same  as  with  pipe
                endpoint  information.  Note: UNIX socket file endpoint infor-
                mation is available only when the compile  flags  line  of  -v
                output contains HASUXSOCKEPT.

                INET socket file endpoint information is inserted to the value
                at the NAME column in th form
                PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe  endpoint  in-
                formation.  The  endpoint information is available only if the
                socket is used for local IPC; both endpoints bind to the  same
                local IPv4 or IPv6 address.

                POSIX  Message Queue file endpoint information is displayed in
                the NAME column in the same form as that of pipe.

                eventfd endpoint information is displayed in the  NAME  column
                in  the same form as that of pipe. This feature works on Linux
                kernels above 5.2.0.

                Multiple occurrences of  this  information  can  appear  in  a
                file's NAME column.

                -E specifies that endpoint supported files should be displayed
                with endpoint information, but not the files of the endpoints.

       +|-f [cfgGn]
                f by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be inter-
                preted.   When followed by c, f, g, G, or n in any combination
                it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure  infor-
                mation is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').

                Normally  a  path  name  argument is taken to be a file system
                name if it matches a mounted-on  directory  name  reported  by
                mount(8),  or  if  it  represents a block device, named in the
                mount output and associated with  a  mounted  directory  name.
                When +f is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to
                be file system names, and lsof will complain if any  are  not.
                This  can  be  useful,  for example, when the file system name
                (mounted-on device) isn't a block device.   This  happens  for
                some CD-ROM file systems.

                When  -f  is specified by itself, all path name arguments will
                be taken to be simple files.  Thus, for example,  the  ``-f --
                /''  arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/'
                path name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.

                Be careful to make sure +f and -f are properly terminated  and
                aren't followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file sys-
                tem name) that might be taken as a  parameter.   For  example,
                use ``--'' after +f and -f as in these examples.

                     $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name
                     $ lsof -f -- /file/name

                The  listing  of  information from kernel file structures, re-
                quested with the +f [cfgGn] option form,  is  normally  inhib-
                ited,  and is not available in whole or part for some dialects
                - e.g., /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22.  When the pre-
                fix  to  f is a plus sign (`+'), these characters request file
                structure information:

                     c    file structure use count (not Linux)
                     f    file structure address (not Linux)
                     g    file flag abbreviations (Linux 2.6.22 and up)

                When the prefix is minus (`-') the same characters disable the
                listing of the indicated values.

                File  structure  addresses,  use  counts,  flags, and node ad-
                dresses may be used to detect more readily identical files in-
                herited  by child processes and identical files in use by dif-
                ferent processes.  Lsof column output can be sorted by  output
                columns  holding  the  values and listed to identify identical
                file use, or lsof field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl
                post-filter script, or by a C program.

       -F f     specifies  a  character list, f, that selects the fields to be
                output for processing by another program,  and  the  character
                that terminates each output field.  Each field to be output is
                specified with a single character in f.  The field  terminator
                defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL (000).  See the OUT-
                PUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for a description of the  field
                identification characters and the field output process.

                When the field selection character list is empty, all standard
                fields are selected (except the  raw  device  field,  security
                context  and  zone field for compatibility reasons) and the NL
                field terminator is used.

                When the field selection character list contains only  a  zero
                (`0'),  all  fields  are selected (except the raw device field
                for compatibility reasons) and the NUL terminator character is
                used.

                Other combinations of fields and their associated field termi-
                nator character must be set with explicit entries in f, as de-
                scribed in the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section.

                When  a field selection character identifies an item lsof does
                not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with -R -  specifica-
                tion of the field character - e.g., ``-FR'' - also selects the
                listing of the item.

                When the field selection character list  contains  the  single
                character  `?',  lsof  will  display  a help list of the field
                identification characters.  (Escape the `?' character as  your
                shell requires.)

       -g [s]   excludes  or  selects  the  listing of files for the processes
                whose optional process group IDentification (PGID) numbers are
                in  the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.
                (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                PGID numbers that begin with `^' (negation)  represent  exclu-
                sions.

                Multiple  PGID  numbers are joined in a single ORed set before
                participating in AND option selection.  However,  PGID  exclu-
                sions  are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect be-
                fore other selection criteria are applied.

                The -g option also enables the output display of PGID numbers.
                When specified without a PGID set that's all it does.

       -i [i]   selects  the  listing  of  files any of whose Internet address
                matches the address specified in i.  If no address  is  speci-
                fied, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25
                (HP-UX) network files.

                If -i4 or -i6 is specified with  no  following  address,  only
                files  of  the  indicated  IP  version, IPv4 or IPv6, are dis-
                played.  (An IPv6 specification may be used only  if  the  di-
                alects supports IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]''
                in lsof's -h or -?   output.)   Sequentially  specifying  -i4,
                followed  by -i6 is the same as specifying -i, and vice-versa.
                Specifying -i4, or -i6 after -i is the same as specifying  -i4
                or -i6 by itself.

                Multiple  addresses  (up  to  a limit of 100) may be specified
                with multiple -i options.  (A  port  number  or  service  name
                range is counted as one address.)  They are joined in a single
                ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in  square
                brackets are optional.):

                [46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]

                where:
                     46 specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6
                          that applies to the following address.
                          '6' may be be specified only if the UNIX
                          dialect supports IPv6.  If neither '4' nor
                          '6' is specified, the following address
                          applies to all IP versions.
                     protocol is a protocol name - TCP, UDP
                     hostname is an Internet host name.  Unless a
                          specific IP version is specified, open
                          network files associated with host names
                          of all versions will be selected.
                     hostaddr is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in
                          dot form; or an IPv6 numeric address in
                          colon form, enclosed in brackets, if the
                          UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP
                          version is selected, only its numeric
                          addresses may be specified.
                     service is an /etc/services name - e.g., smtp -
                          or a list of them.
                     port is a port number, or a list of them.

                IPv6  options  may  be  used only if the UNIX dialect supports
                IPv6.  To see if the dialect supports IPv6, run lsof and spec-
                ify the -h or -?  (help) option.  If the displayed description
                of the -i option contains ``[46]'' and  ``IPv[46]'',  IPv6  is
                supported.

                IPv4  host names and addresses may not be specified if network
                file selection is limited to IPv6 with -i 6.  IPv6 host  names
                and  addresses  may not be specified if network file selection
                is limited to IPv4 with -i  4.   When  an  open  IPv4  network
                file's  address  is mapped in an IPv6 address, the open file's
                type will be IPv6, not IPv4, and its display will be  selected
                by '6', not '4'.

                At  least  one  address  component - 4, 6, protocol, hostname,
                hostaddr, or service - must be supplied.  The  `@'  character,
                leading  the host specification, is always required; as is the
                `:', leading the port specification.  Specify either  hostname
                or  hostaddr.  Specify either service name list or port number
                list.  If a service name list is specified, the  protocol  may
                also  need  to  be  specified if the TCP, UDP and UDPLITE port
                numbers for the service name are different.  Use  any  case  -
                lower or upper - for protocol.

                Service names and port numbers may be combined in a list whose
                entries are separated by commas and whose  numeric  range  en-
                tries  are separated by minus signs.  There may be no embedded
                spaces, and all service names must  belong  to  the  specified
                protocol.   Since  service  names  may  contain embedded minus
                signs, the starting entry of a range can't be a service  name;
                it can be a port number, however.

                Here are some sample addresses:

                     -i6 - IPv6 only
                     TCP:25 - TCP and port 25
                     @1.2.3.4 - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4
                     @[3ffe:1ebc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address
                          3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234
                     UDP:who - UDP who service port
                     TCP@lsof.itap:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap
                     tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10,
                          service name smtp, port 99, host name foo
                     tcp@bar:1-smtp - TCP, ports 1 through smtp, host bar
                     :time - either TCP, UDP or UDPLITE time service port

       -K k     selects  the  listing  of tasks (threads) of processes, on di-
                alects where task (thread) reporting is supported.   (If  help
                output  -  i.e.,  the  output of the -h or -?  options - shows
                this option, then task (thread) reporting is supported by  the
                dialect.)

                If  -K  is  followed  by  a  value, k, it must be ``i''.  That
                causes lsof to ignore  tasks,  particularly  in  the  default,
                list-everything case when no other options are specified.

                When -K and -a are both specified on Linux, and the tasks of a
                main process are selected by other options, the  main  process
                will  also  be  listed as though it were a task, but without a
                task ID.  (See the description of the TID column in the OUTPUT
                section.)

                Where  the  FreeBSD version supports threads, all threads will
                be listed with their IDs.

                In general threads and tasks inherit the files of the  caller,
                but may close some and open others, so lsof always reports all
                the open files of threads and tasks.

       -k k     specifies a kernel name list file, k,  in  place  of  /vmunix,
                /mach,  etc.   -k  is  not  available  under  AIX  on  the IBM
                RISC/System 6000.

       -l       inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to login names.  It
                is also useful when login name lookup is working improperly or
                slowly.

       +|-L [l] enables (`+') or disables  (`-')  the  listing  of  file  link
                counts, where they are available - e.g., they aren't available
                for sockets, or most FIFOs and pipes.

                When +L is specified without  a  following  number,  all  link
                counts will be listed.  When -L is specified (the default), no
                link counts will be listed.

                When +L is followed by a number,  only  files  having  a  link
                count  less  than  that number will be listed.  (No number may
                follow -L.)  A specification of the form ``+L1''  will  select
                open  files  that  have been unlinked.  A specification of the
                form ``+aL1 <file_system>'' will select unlinked open files on
                the specified file system.

                For  other link count comparisons, use field output (-F) and a
                post-processing script or program.

       +|-m m   specifies an alternate kernel memory file or  activates  mount
                table supplement processing.

                The  option  form  -m  m specifies a kernel memory file, m, in
                place of /dev/kmem or /dev/mem - e.g., a crash dump file.

                The option form +m requests that a mount  supplement  file  be
                written  to  the  standard output file.  All other options are
                silently ignored.

                There will be a line in the mount  supplement  file  for  each
                mounted file system, containing the mounted file system direc-
                tory, followed by a single space, followed by the device  num-
                ber in hexadecimal "0x" format - e.g.,

                     / 0x801

                Lsof  can  use the mount supplement file to get device numbers
                for file systems  when  it  can't  get  them  via  stat(2)  or
                lstat(2).

                The option form +m m identifies m as a mount supplement file.

                Note:  the  +m and +m m options are not available for all sup-
                ported dialects.  Check the output of lsof's -h or -?  options
                to see if the +m and +m m options are available.

       +|-M     Enables (+) or disables (-) the reporting of portmapper regis-
                trations for local TCP, UDP and UDPLITE ports, where port map-
                ping is supported.  (See the last paragraph of this option de-
                scription for information about where portmapper  registration
                reporting is supported.)

                The default reporting mode is set by the lsof builder with the
                HASPMAPENABLED #define in the dialect's machine.h header file;
                lsof  is  distributed  with the HASPMAPENABLED #define deacti-
                vated, so portmapper reporting is disabled by default and must
                be requested with +M.  Specifying lsof's -h or -?  option will
                report the default mode.   Disabling  portmapper  registration
                when  it  is  already disabled or enabling it when already en-
                abled is acceptable.  When portmapper  registration  reporting
                is enabled, lsof displays the portmapper registration (if any)
                for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in square brackets immedi-
                ately  following  the  port  numbers  or service names - e.g.,
                ``:1234[name]'' or ``:name[100083]''.  The registration infor-
                mation  may  be a name or number, depending on what the regis-
                tering program supplied to the portmapper when  it  registered
                the port.

                When  portmapper  registration  reporting is enabled, lsof may
                run a little more slowly or even become blocked when access to
                the  portmapper becomes congested or stopped.  Reverse the re-
                porting mode to determine if portmapper registration reporting
                is slowing or blocking lsof.

                For purposes of portmapper registration reporting lsof consid-
                ers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port local if: it is  found  in  the
                local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is lo-
                cated in the foreign part of its containing  kernel  structure
                and  the local and foreign Internet addresses are the same; or
                if it is located in the foreign part of its containing  kernel
                structure  and the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK
                (127.0.0.1).  This rule may  make  lsof  ignore  some  foreign
                ports  on  machines  with multiple interfaces when the foreign
                Internet address is on a different interface  from  the  local
                one.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for
                further discussion of portmapper  registration  reporting  is-
                sues.

                Portmapper  registration  reporting  is  supported only on di-
                alects that have RPC header files.  (Some Linux  distributions
                with  GlibC 2.14 do not have them.)  When portmapper registra-
                tion reporting is supported, the -h or -?   help  output  will
                show the +|-M option.

       -n       inhibits  the  conversion of network numbers to host names for
                network  files.   Inhibiting  conversion  may  make  lsof  run
                faster.   It is also useful when host name lookup is not work-
                ing properly.

       -N       selects the listing of NFS files.

       -o       directs lsof to display file offset at all times.   It  causes
                the  SIZE/OFF  output  column  title  to be changed to OFFSET.
                Note: on some UNIX dialects lsof can't obtain accurate or con-
                sistent  file offset information from its kernel data sources,
                sometimes just for particular kinds  of  files  (e.g.,  socket
                files.)  Consult the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its loca-
                tion.)  for more information.

                The -o and -s options are mutually exclusive; they can't  both
                be  specified.  When neither is specified, lsof displays what-
                ever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for
                the type of the file.

       -o o     defines  the  number of decimal digits (o) to be printed after
                the ``0t'' for a file offset before the form  is  switched  to
                ``0x...''.  An o value of zero (unlimited) directs lsof to use
                the ``0t'' form for all offset output.

                This option does NOT direct lsof  to  display  offset  at  all
                times;  specify -o (without a trailing number) to do that.  -o
                o only specifies the number of digits after ``0t''  in  either
                mixed  size and offset or offset-only output.  Thus, for exam-
                ple, to direct lsof to display offset at all times with a dec-
                imal digit count of 10, use:

                     -o -o 10
                or
                     -oo10

                The  default number of digits allowed after ``0t'' is normally
                8, but may have been changed by the lsof builder.  Consult the
                description  of  the -o o option in the output of the -h or -?
                option to determine the default that is in effect.

       -O       directs lsof to bypass the strategy it  uses  to  avoid  being
                blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked
                child processes.  See the BLOCKS  AND  TIMEOUTS  and  AVOIDING
                KERNEL  BLOCKS  sections for more information on kernel opera-
                tions that may block lsof.

                While use of this option will reduce lsof startup overhead, it
                may also cause lsof to hang when the kernel doesn't respond to
                a function.  Use this option cautiously.

       -p s     excludes or selects the listing of  files  for  the  processes
                whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the
                comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.  (There
                should be no spaces in the set.)

                PID  numbers  that  begin with `^' (negation) represent exclu-
                sions.

                Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a  single  ORed  set
                before  participating  in  AND option selection.  However, PID
                exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect
                before other selection criteria are applied.

       -P       inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for net-
                work files.  Inhibiting the conversion may  make  lsof  run  a
                little faster.  It is also useful when port name lookup is not
                working properly.

       -Q       ignore failed search terms. When lsof is told  to  search  for
                users  of  a file, or for users of a device, or for a specific
                PID, or for certain protocols in use by that PID, and  so  on,
                lsof  will  return  an  error if any of the search results are
                empty. The -Q option will change this behavior  so  that  lsof
                will  instead return a successful exit code (0) even if any of
                the search results are  empty.  In  addition,  missing  search
                terms will not be reported to stderr.

       +|-r [t[c<N>][m<fmt>]]
                puts  lsof in repeat mode.  There lsof lists open files as se-
                lected by other options, delays t seconds  (default  fifteen),
                then  repeats  the  listing, delaying and listing repetitively
                until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the  op-
                tion.

                If  the prefix is a `-', repeat mode is endless.  Lsof must be
                terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.   `c<N>'  is  for
                specifying  the  limits  of repeating; if the number of itera-
                tions reaches at `<N>', Lsof stops itself.

                If the prefix is `+', repeat mode will end the first cycle  no
                open  files  are  listed  - and of course when lsof is stopped
                with an interrupt or quit signal.  When repeat mode  ends  be-
                cause  no files are listed, the process exit code will be zero
                if any open files were ever listed; one,  if  none  were  ever
                listed.

                Lsof  marks  the  end  of  each listing: if field output is in
                progress (the -F, option  has  been  specified),  the  default
                marker  is  `m'; otherwise the default marker is ``========''.
                The marker is followed by a NL character.

                The optional "m<fmt>" argument  specifies  a  format  for  the
                marker  line.   The  <fmt> characters following `m' are inter-
                preted as a format specification to the strftime(3)  function,
                when  both  it  and the localtime(3) function are available in
                the dialect's C library.  Consult the  strftime(3)  documenta-
                tion  for  what  may appear in its format specification.  Note
                that when field output is requested with the -F option,  <fmt>
                cannot  contain  the  NL  format, ``%n''.  Note also that when
                <fmt> contains spaces or  other  characters  that  affect  the
                shell's  interpretation of arguments, <fmt> must be quoted ap-
                propriately.

                Repeat mode reduces lsof startup overhead, so it is more effi-
                cient  to  use this mode than to call lsof repetitively from a
                shell script, for example.

                To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany +|-r with spec-
                ification  of  other  lsof selection options, so the amount of
                kernel memory access lsof does will be kept to a minimum.  Op-
                tions  that filter at the process level - e.g., -c, -g, -p, -u
                - are the most efficient selectors.

                Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see  the
                -F,  option description) and a supervising awk or Perl script,
                or a C program.

       -R       directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification  number
                in the PPID column.

       -s [p:s] s  alone  directs  lsof to display file size at all times.  It
                causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE.
                If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.

                The  optional  -s  p:s form is available only for selected di-
                alects, and only when the -h or -?  help output lists it.

                When the optional form is available, the s may be followed  by
                a  protocol  name  (p), either TCP or UDP, a colon (`:') and a
                comma-separated protocol state name list,  the  option  causes
                open  TCP  and UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s)
                are in the list (s) preceded by a `^'; or  included  if  their
                name(s) are not preceded by a `^'.

                Dialects  that support this option may support only one proto-
                col.  When an unsupported protocol  is  specified,  a  message
                will  be displayed indicating state names for the protocol are
                unavailable.

                When an inclusion list is defined,  only  network  files  with
                state  names  in  the list will be present in the lsof output.
                Thus, specifying one state name means that only network  files
                with that lone state name will be listed.

                Case  is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there
                may be no spaces and the colon (`:') separating  the  protocol
                name (p) and the state name list (s) is required.

                If  only  TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by
                the specified exclusions and inclusions, the -i option must be
                specified,  too.   If only a single protocol's files are to be
                listed, add its name as an argument to the -i option.

                For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN,
                use:

                     -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

                Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states ex-
                cept Idle, use:

                     -iUDP -sUDP:^Idle

                State names vary with UNIX dialects, so it's not  possible  to
                provide  a  complete  list.   Some common TCP state names are:
                CLOSED, IDLE, BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT,  SYN_RCDV,
                ESTABLISHED,   CLOSE_WAIT,   FIN_WAIT1,   CLOSING,   LAST_ACK,
                FIN_WAIT_2, and TIME_WAIT.  Two common UDP state names are Un-
                bound and Idle.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for
                more information on how to use protocol  state  exclusion  and
                inclusion, including examples.

                The -o (without a following decimal digit count) and -s option
                (without a following protocol and state name list)  are  mutu-
                ally exclusive; they can't both be specified.  When neither is
                specified, lsof displays whatever value - size or offset -  is
                appropriate and available for the type of file.

                Since some types of files don't have true sizes - sockets, FI-
                FOs, pipes, etc. - lsof displays for their sizes  the  content
                amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.

       -S [t]   specifies  an optional time-out seconds value for kernel func-
                tions - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) - that might other-
                wise  deadlock.   The  minimum for t is two; the default, fif-
                teen; when no value is specified, the default is used.

                See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS section for more information.

       -T [t]   controls the reporting of some TCP/TPI information,  also  re-
                ported  by  netstat(1),  following  the network addresses.  In
                normal output the information  appears  in  parentheses,  each
                item  except  TCP  or  TPI state name identified by a keyword,
                followed by `=', separated from others by a single space:

                     <TCP or TPI state name>
                     QR=<read queue length>
                     QS=<send queue length>
                     SO=<socket options and values>
                     SS=<socket states>
                     TF=<TCP flags and values>
                     WR=<window read length>
                     WW=<window write length>

                Not all values are reported for all UNIX dialects.  Items val-
                ues (when available) are reported after the item name and '='.

                When  the field output mode is in effect (See OUTPUT FOR OTHER
                PROGRAMS.)  each item appears as a field with  a  `T'  leading
                character.

                -T  with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI informa-
                tion reporting.

                -T with following characters selects the reporting of specific
                TCP/TPI information:

                     f    selects reporting of socket options,
                          states and values, and TCP flags and
                          values.
                     q    selects queue length reporting.
                     s    selects connection state reporting.
                     w    selects window size reporting.

                Not  all selections are enabled for some UNIX dialects.  State
                may be selected for all dialects and is reported  by  default.
                The -h or -?  help output for the -T option will show what se-
                lections may be used with the UNIX dialect.

                When -T is used to select information - i.e., it  is  followed
                by  one or more selection characters - the displaying of state
                is disabled by default, and it  must  be  explicitly  selected
                again  in  the characters following -T.  (In effect, then, the
                default is equivalent to -Ts.)  For example, if queue  lengths
                and state are desired, use -Tqs.

                Socket  options,  socket states, some socket values, TCP flags
                and one TCP value may be reported (when available in the  UNIX
                dialect)  in  the form of the names that commonly appear after
                SO_, so_, SS_, TCP_  and TF_ in the dialect's header  files  -
                most     often     <sys/socket.h>,    <sys/socketvar.h>    and
                <netinet/tcp_var.h>.  Consult those header files for the mean-
                ing of the flags, options, states and values.

                ``SO=''  precedes  socket  options and values; ``SS='', socket
                states; and ``TF='', TCP flags and values.

                If a flag or option has a value, the value will follow an  '='
                and   the   name   --  e.g.,  ``SO=LINGER=5'',  ``SO=QLIM=5'',
                ``TF=MSS=512''.  The following seven values may be reported:

                     Name
                     Reported  Description (Common Symbol)

                     KEEPALIVE keep alive time (SO_KEEPALIVE)
                     LINGER    linger time (SO_LINGER)
                     MSS       maximum segment size (TCP_MAXSEG)
                     PQLEN          partial listen queue connections
                     QLEN      established listen queue connections
                     QLIM      established listen queue limit
                     RCVBUF    receive buffer length (SO_RCVBUF)
                     SNDBUF    send buffer length (SO_SNDBUF)

                Details on what socket options and values, socket states,  and
                TCP  flags and values may be displayed for particular UNIX di-
                alects may be found in the answer to the  ``Why  doesn't  lsof
                report socket options, socket states, and TCP flags and values
                for my dialect?'' and ``Why doesn't lsof  report  the  partial
                listen  queue connection count for my dialect?''  questions in
                the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)   On  Linux
                this option also prints the state of UNIX domain sockets.

       -t       produce  terse  output  comprising  only  process  identifiers
                (without a header), so that it is  easy  to  use  programmati-
                cally. e.g.

                     # reload anything using old SSL
                     lsof -t /lib/*/libssl.so.* | xargs -r kill -HUP

                     # get list of processes and then iterate over them (Bash only)
                     mapfile -t pids < <(
                         lsof -wt /var/log/your.log
                     )
                     for pid in "${pids[@]}" ; do
                         your_command -p "$pid"
                     done

                The -t option implies the -w option.

       -u s     selects the listing of files for the user whose login names or
                user ID numbers are in  the  comma-separated  set  s  -  e.g.,
                ``abe'',  or  ``548,root''.  (There should be no spaces in the
                set.)

                Multiple login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single
                ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                If  a login name or user ID is preceded by a `^', it becomes a
                negation - i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or
                user ID will never be listed.  A negated login name or user ID
                selection is neither ANDed nor ORed with other selections;  it
                is applied before all other selections and absolutely excludes
                the listing of the files of the process.  For example, to  di-
                rect  lsof  to  exclude the listing of files belonging to root
                processes, specify ``-u^root'' or ``-u^0''.

       -U       selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.

       -v       selects the listing of lsof  version  information,  including:
                revision  number;  when  the  lsof binary was constructed; who
                constructed the binary and where; the  name  of  the  compiler
                used  to  construct the lsof binary; the version number of the
                compiler when readily available; the compiler and loader flags
                used  to  construct  the  lsof binary; and system information,
                typically the output of uname's -a option.

       -V       directs lsof to indicate the items it was asked  to  list  and
                failed to find - command names, file names, Internet addresses
                or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.

                When other options  are  ANDed  to  search  options,  or  com-
                pile-time options restrict the listing of some files, lsof may
                not report that it failed to find a search item when an  ANDed
                option or compile-time option prevents the listing of the open
                file containing the located search item.

                For example, ``lsof -V -iTCP@foobar -a -d 999'' may not report
                a  failure  to locate open files at ``TCP@foobar'' and may not
                list any, if none have a file descriptor  number  of  999.   A
                similar  situation  arises when HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECU-
                RITY are defined at compile time and they prevent the  listing
                of open files.

       +|-w     Enables  (+)  or  disables (-) the suppression of warning mes-
                sages.

                The lsof builder may choose to have warning messages  disabled
                or  enabled  by default.  The default warning message state is
                indicated in the output of the -h or  -?   option.   Disabling
                warning  messages  when  they are already disabled or enabling
                them when already enabled is acceptable.

                The -t option implies the -w option.

       -x [fl]  may accompany the +d and +D options to direct their processing
                to  cross  over symbolic links and|or file system mount points
                encountered when scanning the directory (+d) or directory tree
                (+D).

                If  -x  is  specified by itself without a following parameter,
                cross-over processing of both symbolic links and  file  system
                mount points is enabled.  Note that when -x is specified with-
                out a parameter, the next argument must begin with '-' or '+'.

                The optional 'f' parameter enables  file  system  mount  point
                cross-over  processing; 'l', symbolic link cross-over process-
                ing.

                The -x option may not be supplied without also supplying a  +d
                or +D option.

       -X       This is a dialect-specific option.

                nor stopped.  I have never seen this happen or had a report of
                its happening, but I think there is a  remote  possibility  it
                could happen.

                By  default  use  of readx() is disabled.  On AIX 5L and above
                lsof may need setuid-root permission to  perform  the  actions
                this option requests.

                The  lsof builder may specify that the -X option be restricted
                to processes whose real UID is root.  If that has  been  done,
                the -X option will not appear in the -h or -?  help output un-
                less the real UID of the lsof process is  root.   The  default
                lsof  distribution allows any UID to specify -X, so by default
                it will appear in the help output.

                When AIX readx() use is disabled, lsof may not be able to  re-
                port  information for all text and loader file references, but
                it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel directory  search
                kernel error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.

                The readx() function, used by lsof or any other program to ac-
                cess some sections of kernel virtual memory, can  trigger  the
                Stale  Segment ID bug.  It can cause the kernel's dir_search()
                function to believe erroneously that part of an in-memory copy
                of  a file system directory has been zeroed.  Another applica-
                tion process, distinct from lsof, asking the kernel to  search
                the   directory   -   e.g.,  by  using  open(2)  -  can  cause
                dir_search() to loop forever,  thus  hanging  the  application
                process.

                Consult  the  lsof  FAQ  (The FAQ section gives its location.)
                and the 00README file of the lsof distribution for a more com-
                plete  description  of the Stale Segment ID bug, its APAR, and
                methods for defining readx() use when compiling lsof.

           Linux:
                This Linux option requests that lsof skip the reporting of in-
                formation  on  all  open  TCP,  UDP  and UDPLITE IPv4 and IPv6
                files.

                This Linux option is most useful when the system  has  an  ex-
                tremely  large  number of open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE files, the
                processing of whose  information  in  the  /proc/net/tcp*  and
                /proc/net/udp*  files  would  take lsof a long time, and whose
                reporting is not of interest.

                Use this option with care and only when you are sure that  the
                information  you  want  lsof  to display isn't associated with
                open TCP, UDP or UDPLITE socket files.

           Solaris 10 and above:
                This Solaris 10 and above option  requests  the  reporting  of
                cached  paths for files that have been deleted - i.e., removed
                with rm(1) or unlink(2).

                The cached path is followed by the  string  `` (deleted)''  to
                indicate  that  the path by which the file was opened has been
                deleted.

                Because intervening changes made to the path -  i.e.,  renames
                with mv(1) or rename(2) - are not recorded in the cached path,
                what lsof reports is only the  path  by  which  the  file  was
                opened, not its possibly different final path.

       -z [z]   specifies  how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is to be
                handled.

                Without a following argument - e.g., NO z - the option  speci-
                fies  that zone names are to be listed in the ZONE output col-
                umn.

                The -z option may be followed by a zone name, z.  That  causes
                lsof to list only open files for processes in that zone.  Mul-
                tiple -z z option and argument pairs may be specified to  form
                a list of named zones.  Any open file of any process in any of
                the zones will be listed, subject to other  conditions  speci-
                fied by other options and arguments.

       -Z [Z]   specifies how SELinux security contexts are to be handled.  It
                and 'Z' field output  character  support  are  inhibited  when
                SELinux  is  disabled in the running Linux kernel.  See OUTPUT
                FOR OTHER PROGRAMS for more information on the 'Z' field  out-
                put character.

                Without  a following argument - e.g., NO Z - the option speci-
                fies that security contexts are to  be  listed  in  the  SECU-
                RITY-CONTEXT output column.

                The  -Z  option may be followed by a wildcard security context
                name, Z.  That causes lsof to list only open  files  for  pro-
                cesses in that security context.  Multiple -Z Z option and ar-
                gument pairs may be specified to form a list of security  con-
                texts.   Any  open  file of any process in any of the security
                contexts will be listed, subject to other conditions specified
                by  other  options and arguments.  Note that Z can be A:B:C or
                *:B:C or A:B:* or *:*:C to match against the A:B:C context.

       --       The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the  end
                of  the  keyed options.  It may be used, for example, when the
                first file name begins with a minus sign.  It may also be used
                when  the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be
                signified by the presence of a minus sign in the following op-
                tion and before the start of the file names.

       names    These  are  path  names  of  specific files to list.  Symbolic
                links are resolved before use.  The first name  may  be  sepa-
                rated from the preceding options with the ``--'' option.

                If  a name is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the
                device of the file system, lsof will list all the  files  open
                on  the file system.  To be considered a file system, the name
                must match a mounted-on directory name in mount(8) output,  or
                match  the name of a block device associated with a mounted-on
                directory name.  The +|-f option may be used to force lsof  to
                consider a name a file system identifier (+f) or a simple file
                (-f).

                If name is a path to a directory that is  not  the  mounted-on
                directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regu-
                lar file is treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to  pro-
                cesses  that  have  it open as a file or as a process-specific
                directory, such as the root or current working directory.   To
                request that lsof look for open files inside a directory name,
                use the +d s and +D D options.

                If a name is the base name of a family of multiplexed files  -
                e.g,  AIX's  /dev/pt[cs]  -  lsof will list all the associated
                multiplexed  files  on  the  device  that  are  open  -  e.g.,
                /dev/pt[cs]/1, /dev/pt[cs]/2, etc.

                If  a  name  is  a  UNIX domain socket name, lsof will usually
                search for it by the characters of the name alone - exactly as
                it  is  specified  and is recorded in the kernel socket struc-
                ture.  (See the next paragraph for an exception to  that  rule
                for  Linux.)   Specifying  a relative path - e.g., ./file - in
                place of the file's absolute path - e.g.,  /tmp/file  -  won't
                work  because  lsof must match the characters you specify with
                what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.

                If a name is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case lsof
                is  able  to search for it by its device and inode number, al-
                lowing name to be a relative path.  The case requires that the
                absolute  path  --  i.e.,  one beginning with a slash ('/') be
                used by the process that created  the  socket,  and  hence  be
                stored  in  the /proc/net/unix file; and it requires that lsof
                be able to obtain the device and node numbers of both the  ab-
                solute  path in /proc/net/unix and name via successful stat(2)
                system calls.  When those conditions are  met,  lsof  will  be
                able to search for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it
                is is specified in name.  Thus, for example, if  the  path  is
                /dev/log, and an lsof search is initiated when the working di-
                rectory is /dev, then name could be ./log.

                If a name is none of the above, lsof will list any open  files
                whose device and inode match that of the specified path name.

                If  you  have also specified the -b option, the only names you
                may safely specify are file systems for which your mount table
                supplies  alternate  device  numbers.  See the AVOIDING KERNEL
                BLOCKS and ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS sections for more informa-
                tion.

                Multiple  file  names  are  joined in a single ORed set before
                participating in AND option selection.

OPTIONS:
The  options  that  are recognized by iptables and ip6tables can be di-
       vided into several different groups.

   COMMANDS
       These options specify the desired action to perform. Only one  of  them
       can be specified on the command line unless otherwise stated below. For
       long versions of the command and option names, you  need  to  use  only
       enough  letters  to  ensure that iptables can differentiate it from all
       other options.

       -A, --append chain rule-specification
              Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain.  When
              the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one ad-
              dress, a rule will be added for each possible  address  combina-
              tion.

       -C, --check chain rule-specification
              Check  whether  a  rule matching the specification does exist in
              the selected chain. This command uses the same logic  as  -D  to
              find  a matching entry, but does not alter the existing iptables
              configuration and uses its exit  code  to  indicate  success  or
              failure.

       -D, --delete chain rule-specification
       -D, --delete chain rulenum
              Delete one or more rules from the selected chain.  There are two
              versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a  number
              in  the  chain  (starting  at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to
              match.

       -I, --insert chain [rulenum] rule-specification
              Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule
              number.   So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are in-
              serted at the head of the chain.  This is also the default if no
              rule number is specified.

       -R, --replace chain rulenum rule-specification
              Replace a rule in the selected chain.  If the source and/or des-
              tination names resolve to multiple addresses, the  command  will
              fail.  Rules are numbered starting at 1.

       -L, --list [chain]
              List  all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected,
              all chains are listed. Like every other iptables command, it ap-
              plies  to  the  specified  table (filter is the default), so NAT
              rules get listed by
               iptables -t nat -n -L
              Please note that it is often used with the -n option,  in  order
              to  avoid  long reverse DNS lookups.  It is legal to specify the
              -Z (zero) option as well, in which case  the  chain(s)  will  be
              atomically  listed  and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by
              the other arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed  until
              you use
               iptables -L -v
              or iptables-save(8).

       -S, --list-rules [chain]
              Print all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected,
              all chains are printed like iptables-save. Like every other ipt-
              ables  command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the
              default).

       -F, --flush [chain]
              Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is
              given).   This  is  equivalent  to deleting all the rules one by
              one.

       -Z, --zero [chain [rulenum]]
              Zero the packet and byte counters in all  chains,  or  only  the
              given  chain,  or only the given rule in a chain. It is legal to
              specify the -L, --list (list) option as well, to see  the  coun-
              ters immediately before they are cleared. (See above.)

       -N, --new-chain chain
              Create  a  new user-defined chain by the given name.  There must
              be no target of that name already.

       -X, --delete-chain [chain]
              Delete the chain specified.  There must be no references to  the
              chain.   If  there are, you must delete or replace the referring
              rules before the chain can be deleted.  The chain must be empty,
              i.e.  not  contain  any rules.  If no argument is given, it will
              delete all empty chains in the table. Empty builtin  chains  can
              only be deleted with iptables-nft.

       -P, --policy chain target
              Set  the policy for the built-in (non-user-defined) chain to the
              given target.  The policy target must be either ACCEPT or DROP.

       -E, --rename-chain old-chain new-chain
              Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.  This
              is cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the table.

       -h     Help.   Give a (currently very brief) description of the command
              syntax.

   PARAMETERS
       The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used  in  the
       add, delete, insert, replace and append commands).

       -4, --ipv4
              This  option has no effect in iptables and iptables-restore.  If
              a rule using the -4 option is  inserted  with  (and  only  with)
              ip6tables-restore,  it  will be silently ignored. Any other uses
              will throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a
              single  rule  file for use with both iptables-restore and ip6ta-
              bles-restore.

       -6, --ipv6
              If a rule using the -6 option is inserted with (and  only  with)
              iptables-restore,  it  will  be silently ignored. Any other uses
              will throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a
              single  rule  file for use with both iptables-restore and ip6ta-
              bles-restore.  This option has no effect in ip6tables and ip6ta-
              bles-restore.

       [!] -p, --protocol protocol
              The  protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.  The speci-
              fied protocol can be one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, icmpv6,esp,
              ah,  sctp,  mh  or the special keyword "all", or it can be a nu-
              meric value, representing one of these protocols or a  different
              one.   A  protocol  name from /etc/protocols is also allowed.  A
              "!" argument before the protocol inverts the test.   The  number
              zero  is  equivalent to all. "all" will match with all protocols
              and is taken as default when this option is omitted.  Note that,
              in ip6tables, IPv6 extension headers except esp are not allowed.
              esp and ipv6-nonext can be used with Kernel  version  2.6.11  or
              later.   The  number zero is equivalent to all, which means that
              you cannot test the protocol field for the value 0 directly.  To
              match  on a HBH header, even if it were the last, you cannot use
              -p 0, but always need -m hbh.

       [!] -s, --source address[/mask][,...]
              Source specification. Address can be either a  network  name,  a
              hostname,  a  network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP ad-
              dress. Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule  is
              submitted  to  the kernel.  Please note that specifying any name
              to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a  really  bad
              idea.   The  mask  can be either an ipv4 network mask (for ipta-
              bles) or a plain number, specifying the number  of  1's  at  the
              left  side of the network mask.  Thus, an iptables mask of 24 is
              equivalent to 255.255.255.0.  A "!" argument before the  address
              specification  inverts  the sense of the address. The flag --src
              is an alias for this option.  Multiple addresses can  be  speci-
              fied,  but  this will expand to multiple rules (when adding with
              -A), or will cause multiple rules to be deleted (with -D).

       [!] -d, --destination address[/mask][,...]
              Destination  specification.   See  the  description  of  the  -s
              (source)  flag  for  a  detailed description of the syntax.  The
              flag --dst is an alias for this option.

       -m, --match match
              Specifies a match to use, that  is,  an  extension  module  that
              tests  for  a  specific property. The set of matches make up the
              condition under which a target is invoked. Matches are evaluated
              first  to  last  as  specified  on  the command line and work in
              short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension yields false, eval-
              uation will stop.

       -j, --jump target
              This  specifies  the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the
              packet matches it.  The  target  can  be  a  user-defined  chain
              (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special builtin
              targets which decide the fate of the packet immediately,  or  an
              extension  (see EXTENSIONS below).  If this option is omitted in
              a rule (and -g is not used), then matching the rule will have no
              effect  on  the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will
              be incremented.

       -g, --goto chain
              This specifies that the processing should  continue  in  a  user
              specified  chain.  Unlike the --jump option return will not con-
              tinue processing in this chain but instead  in  the  chain  that
              called us via --jump.

       [!] -i, --in-interface name
              Name  of  an interface via which a packet was received (only for
              packets entering the  INPUT,  FORWARD  and  PREROUTING  chains).
              When  the  "!"  argument  is used before the interface name, the
              sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in  a  "+",  then
              any  interface  which begins with this name will match.  If this
              option is omitted, any interface name will match.

       [!] -o, --out-interface name
              Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for
              packets  entering  the  FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains).
              When the "!" argument is used before  the  interface  name,  the
              sense  is  inverted.   If the interface name ends in a "+", then
              any interface which begins with this name will match.   If  this
              option is omitted, any interface name will match.

       [!] -f, --fragment
              This  means that the rule only refers to second and further IPv4
              fragments of fragmented packets.  Since there is no way to  tell
              the source or destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type),
              such a packet will not match any rules which specify them.  When
              the  "!"  argument  precedes  the  "-f" flag, the rule will only
              match head fragments, or unfragmented packets.  This  option  is
              IPv4 specific, it is not available in ip6tables.

       -c, --set-counters packets bytes
              This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte
              counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations).

   OTHER OPTIONS
       The following additional options can be specified:

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose output.  This option makes the list command show the in-
              terface name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS masks.  The
              packet and byte counters are also listed, with the  suffix  'K',
              'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers re-
              spectively (but see the -x flag to change this).  For appending,
              insertion, deletion and replacement, this causes detailed infor-
              mation on the rule or rules to be printed. -v may  be  specified
              multiple  times to possibly emit more detailed debug statements:
              Specified twice, iptables-legacy will dump table  info  and  en-
              tries  in libiptc, iptables-nft dumps rules in netlink (VM code)
              presentation.  Specified three  times,  iptables-nft  will  also
              dump any netlink messages sent to kernel.

       -V, --version
              Show program version and the kernel API used.

       -w, --wait [seconds]
              Wait for the xtables lock.  To prevent multiple instances of the
              program from running concurrently, an attempt will  be  made  to
              obtain  an  exclusive  lock  at launch.  By default, the program
              will exit if the lock cannot be obtained.  This option will make
              the  program  wait  (indefinitely or for optional seconds) until
              the exclusive lock can be obtained.

       -n, --numeric
              Numeric output.  IP addresses and port numbers will  be  printed
              in  numeric format.  By default, the program will try to display
              them as host names, network names, or services (whenever  appli-
              cable).

       -x, --exact
              Expand  numbers.  Display the exact value of the packet and byte
              counters, instead of only the rounded number in  K's  (multiples
              of  1000)  M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M).
              This option is only relevant for the -L command.

       --line-numbers
              When listing rules, add line numbers to the  beginning  of  each
              rule, corresponding to that rule's position in the chain.

       --modprobe=command
              When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use command to load
              any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc).

OPTIONS:
The  options  that  are recognized by iptables and ip6tables can be di-
       vided into several different groups.

   COMMANDS
       These options specify the desired action to perform. Only one  of  them
       can be specified on the command line unless otherwise stated below. For
       long versions of the command and option names, you  need  to  use  only
       enough  letters  to  ensure that iptables can differentiate it from all
       other options.

       -A, --append chain rule-specification
              Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain.  When
              the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one ad-
              dress, a rule will be added for each possible  address  combina-
              tion.

       -C, --check chain rule-specification
              Check  whether  a  rule matching the specification does exist in
              the selected chain. This command uses the same logic  as  -D  to
              find  a matching entry, but does not alter the existing iptables
              configuration and uses its exit  code  to  indicate  success  or
              failure.

       -D, --delete chain rule-specification
       -D, --delete chain rulenum
              Delete one or more rules from the selected chain.  There are two
              versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a  number
              in  the  chain  (starting  at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to
              match.

       -I, --insert chain [rulenum] rule-specification
              Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule
              number.   So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are in-
              serted at the head of the chain.  This is also the default if no
              rule number is specified.

       -R, --replace chain rulenum rule-specification
              Replace a rule in the selected chain.  If the source and/or des-
              tination names resolve to multiple addresses, the  command  will
              fail.  Rules are numbered starting at 1.

       -L, --list [chain]
              List  all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected,
              all chains are listed. Like every other iptables command, it ap-
              plies  to  the  specified  table (filter is the default), so NAT
              rules get listed by
               iptables -t nat -n -L
              Please note that it is often used with the -n option,  in  order
              to  avoid  long reverse DNS lookups.  It is legal to specify the
              -Z (zero) option as well, in which case  the  chain(s)  will  be
              atomically  listed  and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by
              the other arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed  until
              you use
               iptables -L -v
              or iptables-save(8).

       -S, --list-rules [chain]
              Print all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected,
              all chains are printed like iptables-save. Like every other ipt-
              ables  command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the
              default).

       -F, --flush [chain]
              Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is
              given).   This  is  equivalent  to deleting all the rules one by
              one.

       -Z, --zero [chain [rulenum]]
              Zero the packet and byte counters in all  chains,  or  only  the
              given  chain,  or only the given rule in a chain. It is legal to
              specify the -L, --list (list) option as well, to see  the  coun-
              ters immediately before they are cleared. (See above.)

       -N, --new-chain chain
              Create  a  new user-defined chain by the given name.  There must
              be no target of that name already.

       -X, --delete-chain [chain]
              Delete the chain specified.  There must be no references to  the
              chain.   If  there are, you must delete or replace the referring
              rules before the chain can be deleted.  The chain must be empty,
              i.e.  not  contain  any rules.  If no argument is given, it will
              delete all empty chains in the table. Empty builtin  chains  can
              only be deleted with iptables-nft.

       -P, --policy chain target
              Set  the policy for the built-in (non-user-defined) chain to the
              given target.  The policy target must be either ACCEPT or DROP.

       -E, --rename-chain old-chain new-chain
              Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.  This
              is cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the table.

       -h     Help.   Give a (currently very brief) description of the command
              syntax.

   PARAMETERS
       The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used  in  the
       add, delete, insert, replace and append commands).

       -4, --ipv4
              This  option has no effect in iptables and iptables-restore.  If
              a rule using the -4 option is  inserted  with  (and  only  with)
              ip6tables-restore,  it  will be silently ignored. Any other uses
              will throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a
              single  rule  file for use with both iptables-restore and ip6ta-
              bles-restore.

       -6, --ipv6
              If a rule using the -6 option is inserted with (and  only  with)
              iptables-restore,  it  will  be silently ignored. Any other uses
              will throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a
              single  rule  file for use with both iptables-restore and ip6ta-
              bles-restore.  This option has no effect in ip6tables and ip6ta-
              bles-restore.

       [!] -p, --protocol protocol
              The  protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.  The speci-
              fied protocol can be one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, icmpv6,esp,
              ah,  sctp,  mh  or the special keyword "all", or it can be a nu-
              meric value, representing one of these protocols or a  different
              one.   A  protocol  name from /etc/protocols is also allowed.  A
              "!" argument before the protocol inverts the test.   The  number
              zero  is  equivalent to all. "all" will match with all protocols
              and is taken as default when this option is omitted.  Note that,
              in ip6tables, IPv6 extension headers except esp are not allowed.
              esp and ipv6-nonext can be used with Kernel  version  2.6.11  or
              later.   The  number zero is equivalent to all, which means that
              you cannot test the protocol field for the value 0 directly.  To
              match  on a HBH header, even if it were the last, you cannot use
              -p 0, but always need -m hbh.

       [!] -s, --source address[/mask][,...]
              Source specification. Address can be either a  network  name,  a
              hostname,  a  network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP ad-
              dress. Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule  is
              submitted  to  the kernel.  Please note that specifying any name
              to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a  really  bad
              idea.   The  mask  can be either an ipv4 network mask (for ipta-
              bles) or a plain number, specifying the number  of  1's  at  the
              left  side of the network mask.  Thus, an iptables mask of 24 is
              equivalent to 255.255.255.0.  A "!" argument before the  address
              specification  inverts  the sense of the address. The flag --src
              is an alias for this option.  Multiple addresses can  be  speci-
              fied,  but  this will expand to multiple rules (when adding with
              -A), or will cause multiple rules to be deleted (with -D).

       [!] -d, --destination address[/mask][,...]
              Destination  specification.   See  the  description  of  the  -s
              (source)  flag  for  a  detailed description of the syntax.  The
              flag --dst is an alias for this option.

       -m, --match match
              Specifies a match to use, that  is,  an  extension  module  that
              tests  for  a  specific property. The set of matches make up the
              condition under which a target is invoked. Matches are evaluated
              first  to  last  as  specified  on  the command line and work in
              short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension yields false, eval-
              uation will stop.

       -j, --jump target
              This  specifies  the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the
              packet matches it.  The  target  can  be  a  user-defined  chain
              (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special builtin
              targets which decide the fate of the packet immediately,  or  an
              extension  (see EXTENSIONS below).  If this option is omitted in
              a rule (and -g is not used), then matching the rule will have no
              effect  on  the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will
              be incremented.

       -g, --goto chain
              This specifies that the processing should  continue  in  a  user
              specified  chain.  Unlike the --jump option return will not con-
              tinue processing in this chain but instead  in  the  chain  that
              called us via --jump.

       [!] -i, --in-interface name
              Name  of  an interface via which a packet was received (only for
              packets entering the  INPUT,  FORWARD  and  PREROUTING  chains).
              When  the  "!"  argument  is used before the interface name, the
              sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in  a  "+",  then
              any  interface  which begins with this name will match.  If this
              option is omitted, any interface name will match.

       [!] -o, --out-interface name
              Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for
              packets  entering  the  FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains).
              When the "!" argument is used before  the  interface  name,  the
              sense  is  inverted.   If the interface name ends in a "+", then
              any interface which begins with this name will match.   If  this
              option is omitted, any interface name will match.

       [!] -f, --fragment
              This  means that the rule only refers to second and further IPv4
              fragments of fragmented packets.  Since there is no way to  tell
              the source or destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type),
              such a packet will not match any rules which specify them.  When
              the  "!"  argument  precedes  the  "-f" flag, the rule will only
              match head fragments, or unfragmented packets.  This  option  is
              IPv4 specific, it is not available in ip6tables.

       -c, --set-counters packets bytes
              This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte
              counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations).

   OTHER OPTIONS
       The following additional options can be specified:

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose output.  This option makes the list command show the in-
              terface name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS masks.  The
              packet and byte counters are also listed, with the  suffix  'K',
              'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers re-
              spectively (but see the -x flag to change this).  For appending,
              insertion, deletion and replacement, this causes detailed infor-
              mation on the rule or rules to be printed. -v may  be  specified
              multiple  times to possibly emit more detailed debug statements:
              Specified twice, iptables-legacy will dump table  info  and  en-
              tries  in libiptc, iptables-nft dumps rules in netlink (VM code)
              presentation.  Specified three  times,  iptables-nft  will  also
              dump any netlink messages sent to kernel.

       -V, --version
              Show program version and the kernel API used.

       -w, --wait [seconds]
              Wait for the xtables lock.  To prevent multiple instances of the
              program from running concurrently, an attempt will  be  made  to
              obtain  an  exclusive  lock  at launch.  By default, the program
              will exit if the lock cannot be obtained.  This option will make
              the  program  wait  (indefinitely or for optional seconds) until
              the exclusive lock can be obtained.

       -n, --numeric
              Numeric output.  IP addresses and port numbers will  be  printed
              in  numeric format.  By default, the program will try to display
              them as host names, network names, or services (whenever  appli-
              cable).

       -x, --exact
              Expand  numbers.  Display the exact value of the packet and byte
              counters, instead of only the rounded number in  K's  (multiples
              of  1000)  M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M).
              This option is only relevant for the -L command.

       --line-numbers
              When listing rules, add line numbers to the  beginning  of  each
              rule, corresponding to that rule's position in the chain.

       --modprobe=command
              When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use command to load
              any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc).

COMMAND: arp

DESCRIPTION: arp - manipulate the system ARP cache

USAGE: arp [-vn] [-H type] [-i if] [-ae] [hostname]

       arp [-v] [-i if] -d hostname [pub]

       arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -s hostname hw_addr [temp]

       arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -s hostname hw_addr [netmask nm] pub

       arp [-v] [-H type] [-i if] -Ds hostname ifname [netmask nm] pub

       arp [-vnD] [-H type] [-i if] -f [filename]

OPTIONS:
-v, --verbose
              Tell the user what is going on by being verbose.

       -n, --numeric
              shows  numerical  addresses  instead of trying to determine sym-
              bolic host, port or user names.

       -H type, --hw-type type, -t type
              When setting or reading the ARP cache, this  optional  parameter
              tells  arp  which class of entries it should check for.  The de-
              fault value of this parameter is ether (i.e. hardware code  0x01
              for  IEEE  802.3  10Mbps  Ethernet).  Other values might include
              network technologies such as ARCnet (arcnet) , PROnet (pronet) ,
              AX.25 (ax25) and NET/ROM (netrom).

       -a     Use alternate BSD style output format (with no fixed columns).

       -e     Use default Linux style output format (with fixed columns).

       -D, --use-device
              Instead  of  a hw_addr, the given argument is the name of an in-
              terface.  arp will use the MAC address of that interface for the
              table  entry.  This is usually the best option to set up a proxy
              ARP entry to yourself.

       -i If, --device If
              Select an interface. When dumping the  ARP  cache  only  entries
              matching the specified interface will be printed. When setting a
              permanent or temp ARP entry this interface  will  be  associated
              with  the  entry;  if  this  option is not used, the kernel will
              guess based on the routing table. For pub entries the  specified
              interface  is  the  interface  on which ARP requests will be an-
              swered.
              NOTE: This has to be different from the interface to  which  the
              IP  datagrams will be routed.  NOTE: As of kernel 2.2.0 it is no
              longer possible to set an ARP entry for an entire subnet.  Linux
              instead  does  automagic proxy arp when a route exists and it is
              forwarding. See arp(7) for  details.  Also  the  dontpub  option
              which  is available for delete and set operations cannot be used
              with 2.4 and newer kernels.

       -f filename, --file filename
              Similar to the -s option, only this time  the  address  info  is
              taken from file filename.  This can be used if ARP entries for a
              lot of hosts have to be set up.  The name of the  data  file  is
              very often /etc/ethers, but this is not official. If no filename
              is specified /etc/ethers is used as default.

              The format of the file is simple; it only  contains  ASCII  text
              lines  with  a  hostname,  and  a  hardware address separated by
              whitespace. Additionally the pub, temp and netmask flags can  be
              used.

       In  all  places  where a hostname is expected, one can also enter an IP
       address in dotted-decimal notation.

       As a special case for compatibility the order of the hostname  and  the
       hardware address can be exchanged.

       Each  complete  entry  in the ARP cache will be marked with the C flag.
       Permanent entries are marked with M and published entries  have  the  P
       flag.

COMMAND INPUT:
arp -a

COMMAND OUTPUT:
# Error executing 'arp -a': [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'arp'

COMMAND: ip

DESCRIPTION: ip - show / manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels

USAGE: ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       ip [ -force ] -batch filename

       OBJECT := { link | address | addrlabel | route | rule | neigh | ntable
               | tunnel | tuntap | maddress | mroute | mrule | monitor | xfrm
               | netns | l2tp | tcp_metrics | token | macsec | vrf | mptcp |
               ioam | stats }

       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -h[uman-readable] | -s[tatistics] |
               -d[etails] | -r[esolve] | -iec | -f[amily] { inet | inet6 |
               link } | -4 | -6 | -B | -0 | -l[oops] { maximum-addr-flush-at-
               tempts } | -o[neline] | -rc[vbuf] [size] | -t[imestamp] |
               -ts[hort] | -n[etns] name | -N[umeric] | -a[ll] | -c[olor] |
               -br[ief] | -j[son] | -p[retty] }

OPTIONS:
-V, -Version
              Print the version of the ip utility and exit.

       -h, -human, -human-readable
              output statistics with human readable values followed by suffix.

       -b, -batch <FILENAME>
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke
              them.  First failure will cause termination of ip.

       -force Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode.  If there were any
              errors during execution of the commands, the application return
              code will be non zero.

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              Output more information. If the option appears twice or more,
              the amount of information increases.  As a rule, the information
              is statistics or some time values.

       -d, -details
              Output more detailed information.

       -l, -loops <COUNT>
              Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic
              will attempt before giving up. The default is 10.  Zero (0)
              means loop until all addresses are removed.

       -f, -family <FAMILY>
              Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family iden-
              tifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link.  If this
              option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other
              arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough
              information to guess the family, ip falls back to the default
              one, usually inet or any.  link is a special family identifier
              meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

       -4     shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     shortcut for -family inet6.

       -B     shortcut for -family bridge.

       -M     shortcut for -family mpls.

       -0     shortcut for -family link.

       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with
              the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to count
              records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

       -r, -resolve
              use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of
              host addresses.

       -n, -netns <NETNS>
              switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually
              it just simplifies executing of:

              ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -N, -Numeric
              Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly in-
              stead of converting it to human readable name.

       -a, -all
              executes specified command over all objects, it depends if com-
              mand supports this option.

       -c[color][={always|auto|never}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color
              output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If parameter is
              auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color
              output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled. If
              specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence. This
              flag is ignored if -json is also given.

              Used color palette can be influenced by COLORFGBG environment
              variable (see ENVIRONMENT).

       -t, -timestamp
              display current time when using monitor option.

       -ts, -tshort
              Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

       -rc, -rcvbuf<SIZE>
              Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

       -iec   print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

       -br, -brief
              Print only basic information in a tabular format for better
              readability. This option is currently only supported by ip addr
              show , ip link show & ip neigh show commands.

       -j, -json
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       -p, -pretty
              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse
              but hard for most users to read.  This flag adds indentation for
              readability.

       -echo  Request the kernel to send the applied configuration back.

COMMAND: hostname

DESCRIPTION: hostname - show or set the system's host name
       domainname - show or set the system's NIS/YP domain name
       ypdomainname - show or set the system's NIS/YP domain name
       nisdomainname - show or set the system's NIS/YP domain name
       dnsdomainname - show the system's DNS domain name

USAGE: hostname [-a|--alias] [-d|--domain] [-f|--fqdn|--long] [-A|--all-fqdns]
       [-i|--ip-address] [-I|--all-ip-addresses] [-s|--short] [-y|--yp|--nis]

       nisdomainname [nisdomain] [-F file]

       dnsdomainname

OPTIONS:
-a, --alias
              Display  the  alias  name  of the host (if used). This option is
              deprecated and should not be used anymore.

       -A, --all-fqdns
              Displays all FQDNs of the machine. This  option  enumerates  all
              configured  network  addresses  on all configured network inter-
              faces, and translates them to DNS domain names.  Addresses  that
              cannot be translated (i.e. because they do not have an appropri-
              ate reverse IP entry) are skipped. Note that different addresses
              may  resolve  to the same name, therefore the output may contain
              duplicate entries. Do not make any assumptions about  the  order

       -b, --boot
              Always  set  a hostname; this allows the file specified by -F to
              be non-existent or empty, in which case the default hostname lo-
              calhost will be used if none is yet set.

       -d, --domain
              Display  the  name of the DNS domain.  Don't use the command do-
              mainname to get the DNS domain name because it will show the NIS
              domain  name  and not the DNS domain name. Use dnsdomainname in-

              ing this option.

       -f, --fqdn, --long
              Display  the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). A FQDN consists
              of a short host name and the DNS domain name. Unless you are us-
              ing bind or NIS for host lookups you can change the FQDN and the
              DNS domain name (which is part of the FQDN)  in  the  /etc/hosts
              file.  See  the warnings in section THE FQDN above und use host-
              name --all-fqdns instead wherever possible.

       -F, --file filename
              Read the host name from  the  specified  file.  Comments  (lines
              starting with a `#') are ignored.

       -i, --ip-address
              Display the network address(es) of the host name. Note that this
              works only if the host name can be resolved.  Avoid  using  this
              option; use hostname --all-ip-addresses instead.

       -I, --all-ip-addresses
              Display  all  network addresses of the host. This option enumer-
              ates all configured addresses on  all  network  interfaces.  The
              loopback  interface  and  IPv6 link-local addresses are omitted.
              Contrary to option -i, this option does not depend on name reso-
              lution.  Do not make any assumptions about the order of the out-
              put.

       -s, --short
              Display the short host name. This is the host name  cut  at  the
              first dot.

       -V, --version
              Print  version  information on standard output and exit success-

       -y, --yp, --nis
              Display the NIS domain name. If a parameter is given (or  --file

OPTIONS:
-V, -Version
              Print the version of the ip utility and exit.

       -h, -human, -human-readable
              output statistics with human readable values followed by suffix.

       -b, -batch <FILENAME>
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke
              them.  First failure will cause termination of ip.

       -force Don't terminate ip on errors in batch mode.  If there were any
              errors during execution of the commands, the application return
              code will be non zero.

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              Output more information. If the option appears twice or more,
              the amount of information increases.  As a rule, the information
              is statistics or some time values.

       -d, -details
              Output more detailed information.

       -l, -loops <COUNT>
              Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic
              will attempt before giving up. The default is 10.  Zero (0)
              means loop until all addresses are removed.

       -f, -family <FAMILY>
              Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family iden-
              tifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link.  If this
              option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other
              arguments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough
              information to guess the family, ip falls back to the default
              one, usually inet or any.  link is a special family identifier
              meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

       -4     shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     shortcut for -family inet6.

       -B     shortcut for -family bridge.

       -M     shortcut for -family mpls.

       -0     shortcut for -family link.

       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with
              the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to count
              records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

       -r, -resolve
              use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of
              host addresses.

       -n, -netns <NETNS>
              switches ip to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually
              it just simplifies executing of:

              ip netns exec NETNS ip [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              ip -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -N, -Numeric
              Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly in-
              stead of converting it to human readable name.

       -a, -all
              executes specified command over all objects, it depends if com-
              mand supports this option.

       -c[color][={always|auto|never}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color
              output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If parameter is
              auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color
              output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled. If
              specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence. This
              flag is ignored if -json is also given.

              Used color palette can be influenced by COLORFGBG environment
              variable (see ENVIRONMENT).

       -t, -timestamp
              display current time when using monitor option.

       -ts, -tshort
              Like -timestamp, but use shorter format.

       -rc, -rcvbuf<SIZE>
              Set the netlink socket receive buffer size, defaults to 1MB.

       -iec   print human readable rates in IEC units (e.g. 1Ki = 1024).

       -br, -brief
              Print only basic information in a tabular format for better
              readability. This option is currently only supported by ip addr
              show , ip link show & ip neigh show commands.

       -j, -json
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       -p, -pretty
              The default JSON format is compact and more efficient to parse
              but hard for most users to read.  This flag adds indentation for
              readability.

       -echo  Request the kernel to send the applied configuration back.

COMMAND: pstree

DESCRIPTION: pstree - display a tree of processes

USAGE: pstree [-a, --arguments] [-c, --compact-not] [-C, --color attr]
       [-g, --show-pgids] [-h, --highlight-all, -H pid, --highlight-pid pid]
       [-l, --long] [-n, --numeric-sort] [-N, --ns-sort ns] [-p, --show-pids]
       [-s, --show-parents] [-S, --ns-changes] [-t, --thread-names]
       [-T, --hide-threads] [-u, --uid-changes] [-Z, --security-context]
       [-A, --ascii, -G, --vt100, -U, --unicode] [pid, user]
       pstree -V, --version

OPTIONS:
-a     Show  command  line arguments.  If the command line of a process
              is swapped out, that process is shown in  parentheses.   -a  im-
              plicitly disables compaction for processes but not threads.

       -A     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.

       -c     Disable  compaction of identical subtrees.  By default, subtrees
              are compacted whenever possible.

       -C     Color the process name by given attribute. Currently pstree only
              accepts  the  value  age which colors by process age.  Processes
              newer than 60 seconds are green, newer than an hour  yellow  and
              the remaining red.

       -g     Show  PGIDs.   Process Group IDs are shown as decimal numbers in
              parentheses after each process name.  If both PIDs and PGIDs are
              displayed then PIDs are shown first.

       -G     Use VT100 line drawing characters.

       -h     Highlight  the current process and its ancestors.  This is a no-
              op if the terminal doesn't support highlighting  or  if  neither
              the  current process nor any of its ancestors are in the subtree
              being shown.

       -H     Like -h, but highlight the specified  process  instead.   Unlike
              with  -h,  pstree  fails  when  using  -H if highlighting is not
              available.

       -l     Display long lines.  By default, lines are truncated  to  either
              the  COLUMNS environment variable or the display width.  If nei-
              ther of these methods work, the default of 132 columns is used.

       -n     Sort processes with the same parent by PID instead of  by  name.
              (Numeric sort.)

       -N     Show  individual trees for each namespace of the type specified.
              The available types are: ipc, mnt, net, pid,  time,  user,  uts.
              Regular users don't have access to other users' processes infor-
              mation, so the output will be limited.

       -p     Show PIDs.  PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses af-
              ter each process name.  -p implicitly disables compaction.

       -s     Show parent processes of the specified process.

       -S     Show  namespaces  transitions.   Like  -N, the output is limited
              when running as a regular user.

       -t     Show full names for threads when available.

       -T     Hide threads and only show processes.

       -u     Show uid transitions.  Whenever the uid  of  a  process  differs
              from  the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown in parentheses
              after the process name.

       -U     Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under Linux 1.1-54
              and  above,  UTF-8  mode  is entered on the console with echo -e
              ' 33%8' and left with echo -e ' 33%@'.

       -V     Display version information.

       -Z     Show the current security attributes of the process. For SELinux
              systems this will be the security context.

COMMAND: lsof

DESCRIPTION: lsof - list open files

USAGE: lsof  [  -?abChlnNOPQRtUvVX  ]  [ -A A ] [ -c c ] [ +c c ] [ +|-d d ] [
       +|-D D ] [ +|-e s ] [ +|-E ] [ +|-f [cfgGn] ] [ -F [f] ] [ -g [s]  ]  [
       -i  [i] ] [ -k k ] [ -K k ] [ +|-L [l] ] [ +|-m m ] [ +|-M ] [ -o [o] ]

OPTIONS:
In the absence of any options, lsof lists all open files  belonging  to
       all active processes.

       If  any  list  request option is specified, other list requests must be
       specifically requested - e.g., if -U is specified for  the  listing  of
       UNIX  socket  files, NFS files won't be listed unless -N is also speci-
       fied; or if a user list is specified with the -u  option,  UNIX  domain
       socket  files,  belonging to users not in the list, won't be listed un-
       less the -U option is also specified.

       Normally, list options that are specifically stated are  ORed  -  i.e.,
       specifying  the  -i option without an address and the -ufoo option pro-
       duces a listing of all network files OR files  belonging  to  processes
       owned by user ``foo''.  The exceptions are:

       1) the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the -u
          option;

       2) the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the -p option;

       3) the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the -g op-
          tion;

       4) the `^' (negated) command, specified with the -c option;

       5) the  (`^')  negated  TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with
          the -s [p:s] option.

       Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or AND-
       ing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.

       The -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example, specify-
       ing -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that
       belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.

       Caution:  the  -a option causes all list selection options to be ANDed;
       it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options
       by  placing it between them, even though its placement there is accept-
       able.  Wherever -a is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection op-
       tions.

       Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, net-
       work addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names,  se-
       curity  contexts  -  are joined in a single ORed set and applied before
       the result participates  in  ANDing.   Thus,  for  example,  specifying
       -i@aaa.bbb,  -i@ccc.ddd,  -a,  and -ufff,ggg will select the listing of
       files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND  have  network
       connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.

       Options  may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the
       option set ``-a -b -C'' may be stated as -abC.  However,  since  values
       are optional following +|-f, -F, -g, -i, +|-L, -o, +|-r, -s, -S, -T, -x
       and -z.  when you have no values for them be careful that the following
       character isn't ambiguous.  For example, -Fn might represent the -F and
       -n options, or it might represent the n field identifier character fol-
       lowing  the  -F option.  When ambiguity is possible, start a new option
       with a `-' character - e.g., ``-F -n''.  If the next option is  a  file
       name,  follow the possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g., ``-F --
       name''.

       Either the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of  options.
       Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., -i
       - may be grouped under either prefix.  Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may
       be  stated  as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate op-
       tions.  Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options  in  the
       group  does  take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g.,
       +|-M; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''.  When in doubt, use
       separate options with appropriate prefixes.

       -? -h    These  two  equivalent  options  select  a usage (help) output
                list.  Lsof displays a shortened form of this output  when  it
                detects  an  error in the options supplied to it, after it has
                displayed messages explaining each  error.   (Escape  the  `?'
                character as your shell requires.)

       -a       causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.

       -A A     is  available  on  systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel
                code is implemented via dynamic modules.  It allows  the  lsof
                user  to  specify  A  as an alternate name list file where the
                kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be  found.   See
                the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more
                information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they
                affect lsof.

       -b       causes  lsof  to  avoid  kernel  functions  that might block -
                lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).

                See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING  KERNEL  BLOCKS  sec-
                tions for information on using this option.

       -c c     selects  the listing of files for processes executing the com-
                mand that begins with the characters of c.  Multiple  commands
                may  be specified, using multiple -c options.  They are joined
                in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selec-
                tion.

                If  c begins with a `^', then the following characters specify
                a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)

                If c begins and ends with a slash ('/'),  the  characters  be-
                tween  the  slashes  are  interpreted as a regular expression.
                Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted
                to  prevent  their  interpretation  by the shell.  The closing
                slash may be followed by these modifiers:

                     b    the regular expression is a basic one.
                     i    ignore the case of letters.
                     x    the regular expression is an extended one
                          (default).

                See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives  its  location.)   for
                more information on basic and extended regular expressions.

                The  simple  command  specification  is tested first.  If that
                test fails, the command regular expression is applied.  If the
                simple  command  test succeeds, the command regular expression
                test isn't made.  This may result in ``no  command  found  for
                regex:'' messages when lsof's -V option is specified.

       +c w     defines  the maximum number of initial characters of the name,
                supplied by the UNIX dialect, of the UNIX  command  associated
                with a process to be printed in the COMMAND column.  (The lsof
                default is nine.)

                Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply  all  command  name
                characters to lsof in the files and structures from which lsof
                obtains command name.  Often  dialects  limit  the  number  of
                characters  supplied  in  those  sources.   For example, Linux
                2.4.27 and Solaris 9 both limit  command  name  length  to  16
                characters.

                If w is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to lsof by
                the UNIX dialect will be printed.

                If w is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'',
                it will be raised to that length.

       -C       disables  the  reporting  of any path name components from the
                kernel's name cache.  See the KERNEL NAME  CACHE  section  for
                more information.

       +d s     causes  lsof  to  search for all open instances of directory s
                and the files and directories it contains at  its  top  level.
                +d does NOT descend the directory tree, rooted at s.  The +D D
                option may be used to request a  full-descent  directory  tree
                search, rooted at directory D.

                Processing  of  the  +d  option does not follow symbolic links
                within s unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor
                does  it  search for open files on file system mount points on
                subdirectories of s unless the -x or  -x   f  option  is  also
                specified.

                Note:  the  authority  of the user of this option limits it to
                searching for files that the user has  permission  to  examine
                with the system stat(2) function.

       -d s     specifies  a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or
                include in the output listing.  The file descriptors are spec-
                ified  in  the  comma-separated  set  s  -  e.g., ``cwd,1,3'',
                ``^6,^2''.  (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set  begin
                with  `^'.   It  is  an inclusion list if no entry begins with
                `^'.  Mixed lists are not permitted.

                A file descriptor number range may be in the set  as  long  as
                neither  member  is  empty,  both members are numbers, and the
                ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g.,  ``0-7''
                or  ``3-10''.   Ranges  may be specified for exclusion if they
                have the `^' prefix - e.g., ``^0-7''  excludes  all  file  de-
                scriptors 0 through 7.

                Multiple  file  descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed
                set before participating in AND option selection.

                When there are exclusion and inclusion  members  in  the  set,
                lsof  reports  them as errors and exits with a non-zero return
                code.

                See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output  values  in
                the  OUTPUT  section  for  more information on file descriptor
                names.

                fd is a pseudo file descriptor name for specifying  the  whole
                range of possible file descriptor numbers.  fd does not appear
                in FD column of output.

       +D D     causes lsof to search for all open instances  of  directory  D
                and  all the files and directories it contains to its complete
                depth.

                Processing of the +D option does  not  follow  symbolic  links
                within D unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor
                does it search for open files on file system mount  points  on
                subdirectories  of  D  unless  the  -x or -x  f option is also
                specified.

                Note: the authority of the user of this option  limits  it  to
                searching  for  files  that the user has permission to examine
                with the system stat(2) function.

                Further note: lsof may process this option slowly and  require
                a large amount of dynamic memory to do it.  This is because it
                must descend the entire directory tree, rooted at  D,  calling
                stat(2)  for  each  file and directory, building a list of all
                the files it finds, and searching that list for a  match  with
                every  open  file.  When directory D is large, these steps can
                take a long time, so use this option prudently.

       -D D     directs lsof's use of the device cache file.  The use of  this
                option  is  sometimes  restricted.   See the DEVICE CACHE FILE
                section and the sections that follow it for  more  information
                on this option.

                -D  must be followed by a function letter; the function letter
                may optionally be followed by a path  name.   Lsof  recognizes
                these function letters:

                     ? - report device cache file paths
                     b - build the device cache file
                     i - ignore the device cache file
                     r - read the device cache file
                     u - read and update the device cache file

                The  b,  r,  and  u functions, accompanied by a path name, are
                sometimes restricted.  When these  functions  are  restricted,
                they  will not appear in the description of the -D option that
                accompanies -h or -?  option output.   See  the  DEVICE  CACHE
                FILE section and the sections that follow it for more informa-
                tion on these functions and when they're restricted.

                The ?  function reports the read-only  and  write  paths  that
                lsof can use for the device cache file, the names of any envi-
                ronment variables whose values lsof will examine when  forming
                the  device  cache  file path, and the format for the personal
                device cache file path.  (Escape the  `?'  character  as  your
                shell requires.)

                When  available,  the b, r, and u functions may be followed by
                the  device  cache  file's  path.   The  standard  default  is
                .lsof_hostname  in the home directory of the real user ID that
                executes lsof, but this could have been changed when lsof  was
                configured  and  compiled.   (The output of the -h and -?  op-
                tions show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.)  The
                suffix,  hostname,  is  the first component of the host's name
                returned by gethostname(2).

                When available, the b function directs lsof to build a new de-
                vice cache file at the default or specified path.

                The i function directs lsof to ignore the default device cache
                file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls
                to the kernel.

                The  r  function  directs lsof to read the device cache at the
                default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new
                device  cache file when none exists or the existing one is im-
                properly structured.  The r function, when specified without a
                path  name,  prevents  lsof from updating an incorrect or out-
                dated device cache file, or creating a new one in  its  place.
                The  r function is always available when it is specified with-
                out a path name argument; it may be restricted by the  permis-
                sions of the lsof process.

                When available, the u function directs lsof to read the device
                cache file at the default or specified path, if possible,  and
                to rebuild it, if necessary.  This is the default device cache
                file function when no -D option has been specified.

       +|-e s   exempts the file system whose path name is s from  being  sub-
                jected  to kernel function calls that might block.  The +e op-
                tion exempts stat(2), lstat(2)  and  most  readlink(2)  kernel
                function  calls.   The  -e  option  exempts  only  stat(2) and
                lstat(2) kernel function calls.  Multiple file systems may  be
                specified  with separate +|-e specifications and each may have
                readlink(2) calls exempted or not.

                This option is currently implemented only for Linux.

                CAUTION: this option can easily be mis-applied to  other  than
                the  file system of interest, because it uses path name rather
                than the more reliable device and inode numbers.  (Device  and
                inode  numbers  are  acquired  via  the  potentially  blocking
                stat(2) kernel call and are thus not available,  but  see  the
                +|-m  m  option as a possible alternative way to supply device
                numbers.)  Use this option with great care and  fully  specify
                the path name of the file system to be exempted.

                When  open files on exempted file systems are reported, it may
                not be possible to obtain all their  information.   Therefore,
                some   information  columns  will  be  blank,  the  characters
                ``UNKN'' preface the values in the TYPE column, and the appli-
                cable  exemption  option is added in parentheses to the end of
                the NAME column.  (Some device  number  information  might  be
                made available via the +|-m m option.)

       +|-E     +E specifies that Linux pipe, Linux UNIX socket, Linux INET(6)
                socket closed in a local  host,  Linux  pseudoterminal  files,
                POSIX  Message  Queueue  implementation  in  Linux,  and Linux
                eventfd should be displayed with endpoint information and  the
                files of the endpoints should also be displayed.

                Note  1:  UNIX socket file endpoint information is only avail-
                able when the compile flags line of -v output contains  HASUX-
                SOCKEPT, and psudoterminal endpoint information is only avail-
                able when the compile flags line contains HASPTYEPT.

                Note 2: POSIX Message Queue file endpoint information is  only
                available when mqueue file system is mounted.

                Pipe  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME column in
                the form ``PID,cmd,FDmode'', where PID is the endpoint process
                ID;  cmd  is  the endpoint process command; FD is the endpoint
                file's descriptor; and mode  is  the  endpoint  file's  access
                mode.

                Pseudoterminal  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME
                column as  ``->/dev/ptsmin PID,cmd,FDmode''  or  ``PID,cmd,FD-
                mode''.   The  first  form is for a master device; the second,
                for a slave device.  min is a slave device's minor device num-
                ber;  and PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe end-
                point information.  Note: psudoterminal  endpoint  information
                is  only  available  when  the compile flags line of -V output
                contains HASPTYEPT. In addition, this feature works  on  Linux
                kernels above 4.13.0.

                UNIX socket file endpoint information is displayed in the NAME
                column in the form
                ``type=TYPE ->INO=INODE PID,cmd,FDmode'', where  TYPE  is  the
                socket  type;  INODE  is  the  i-node  number of the connected
                socket; and PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same  as  with  pipe
                endpoint  information.  Note: UNIX socket file endpoint infor-
                mation is available only when the compile  flags  line  of  -v
                output contains HASUXSOCKEPT.

                INET socket file endpoint information is inserted to the value
                at the NAME column in th form
                PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe  endpoint  in-
                formation.  The  endpoint information is available only if the
                socket is used for local IPC; both endpoints bind to the  same
                local IPv4 or IPv6 address.

                POSIX  Message Queue file endpoint information is displayed in
                the NAME column in the same form as that of pipe.

                eventfd endpoint information is displayed in the  NAME  column
                in  the same form as that of pipe. This feature works on Linux
                kernels above 5.2.0.

                Multiple occurrences of  this  information  can  appear  in  a
                file's NAME column.

                -E specifies that endpoint supported files should be displayed
                with endpoint information, but not the files of the endpoints.

       +|-f [cfgGn]
                f by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be inter-
                preted.   When followed by c, f, g, G, or n in any combination
                it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure  infor-
                mation is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').

                Normally  a  path  name  argument is taken to be a file system
                name if it matches a mounted-on  directory  name  reported  by
                mount(8),  or  if  it  represents a block device, named in the
                mount output and associated with  a  mounted  directory  name.
                When +f is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to
                be file system names, and lsof will complain if any  are  not.
                This  can  be  useful,  for example, when the file system name
                (mounted-on device) isn't a block device.   This  happens  for
                some CD-ROM file systems.

                When  -f  is specified by itself, all path name arguments will
                be taken to be simple files.  Thus, for example,  the  ``-f --
                /''  arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/'
                path name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.

                Be careful to make sure +f and -f are properly terminated  and
                aren't followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file sys-
                tem name) that might be taken as a  parameter.   For  example,
                use ``--'' after +f and -f as in these examples.

                     $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name
                     $ lsof -f -- /file/name

                The  listing  of  information from kernel file structures, re-
                quested with the +f [cfgGn] option form,  is  normally  inhib-
                ited,  and is not available in whole or part for some dialects
                - e.g., /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22.  When the pre-
                fix  to  f is a plus sign (`+'), these characters request file
                structure information:

                     c    file structure use count (not Linux)
                     f    file structure address (not Linux)
                     g    file flag abbreviations (Linux 2.6.22 and up)

                          Abbrev.   Flag in C code (see open(2))

                     G    file flags in hexadecimal (Linux 2.6.22 and up)
                     n    file structure node address (not Linux)

                When the prefix is minus (`-') the same characters disable the
                listing of the indicated values.

                File  structure  addresses,  use  counts,  flags, and node ad-
                dresses may be used to detect more readily identical files in-
                herited  by child processes and identical files in use by dif-
                ferent processes.  Lsof column output can be sorted by  output
                columns  holding  the  values and listed to identify identical
                file use, or lsof field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl
                post-filter script, or by a C program.

       -F f     specifies  a  character list, f, that selects the fields to be
                output for processing by another program,  and  the  character
                that terminates each output field.  Each field to be output is
                specified with a single character in f.  The field  terminator
                defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL (000).  See the OUT-
                PUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for a description of the  field
                identification characters and the field output process.

                When the field selection character list is empty, all standard
                fields are selected (except the  raw  device  field,  security
                context  and  zone field for compatibility reasons) and the NL
                field terminator is used.

                When the field selection character list contains only  a  zero
                (`0'),  all  fields  are selected (except the raw device field
                for compatibility reasons) and the NUL terminator character is
                used.

                Other combinations of fields and their associated field termi-
                nator character must be set with explicit entries in f, as de-
                scribed in the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section.

                When  a field selection character identifies an item lsof does
                not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with -R -  specifica-
                tion of the field character - e.g., ``-FR'' - also selects the
                listing of the item.

                When the field selection character list  contains  the  single
                character  `?',  lsof  will  display  a help list of the field
                identification characters.  (Escape the `?' character as  your
                shell requires.)

       -g [s]   excludes  or  selects  the  listing of files for the processes
                whose optional process group IDentification (PGID) numbers are
                in  the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.
                (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                PGID numbers that begin with `^' (negation)  represent  exclu-
                sions.

                Multiple  PGID  numbers are joined in a single ORed set before
                participating in AND option selection.  However,  PGID  exclu-
                sions  are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect be-
                fore other selection criteria are applied.

                The -g option also enables the output display of PGID numbers.
                When specified without a PGID set that's all it does.

       -i [i]   selects  the  listing  of  files any of whose Internet address
                matches the address specified in i.  If no address  is  speci-
                fied, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25
                (HP-UX) network files.

                If -i4 or -i6 is specified with  no  following  address,  only
                files  of  the  indicated  IP  version, IPv4 or IPv6, are dis-
                played.  (An IPv6 specification may be used only  if  the  di-
                alects supports IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]''
                in lsof's -h or -?   output.)   Sequentially  specifying  -i4,
                followed  by -i6 is the same as specifying -i, and vice-versa.
                Specifying -i4, or -i6 after -i is the same as specifying  -i4
                or -i6 by itself.

                Multiple  addresses  (up  to  a limit of 100) may be specified
                with multiple -i options.  (A  port  number  or  service  name
                range is counted as one address.)  They are joined in a single
                ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in  square
                brackets are optional.):

                [46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]

                where:
                     46 specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6
                          that applies to the following address.
                          '6' may be be specified only if the UNIX
                          dialect supports IPv6.  If neither '4' nor
                          '6' is specified, the following address
                          applies to all IP versions.
                     protocol is a protocol name - TCP, UDP
                     hostname is an Internet host name.  Unless a
                          specific IP version is specified, open
                          network files associated with host names
                          of all versions will be selected.
                     hostaddr is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in
                          dot form; or an IPv6 numeric address in
                          colon form, enclosed in brackets, if the
                          UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP
                          version is selected, only its numeric
                          addresses may be specified.
                     service is an /etc/services name - e.g., smtp -
                          or a list of them.
                     port is a port number, or a list of them.

                IPv6  options  may  be  used only if the UNIX dialect supports
                IPv6.  To see if the dialect supports IPv6, run lsof and spec-
                ify the -h or -?  (help) option.  If the displayed description
                of the -i option contains ``[46]'' and  ``IPv[46]'',  IPv6  is
                supported.

                IPv4  host names and addresses may not be specified if network
                file selection is limited to IPv6 with -i 6.  IPv6 host  names
                and  addresses  may not be specified if network file selection
                is limited to IPv4 with -i  4.   When  an  open  IPv4  network
                file's  address  is mapped in an IPv6 address, the open file's
                type will be IPv6, not IPv4, and its display will be  selected
                by '6', not '4'.

                At  least  one  address  component - 4, 6, protocol, hostname,
                hostaddr, or service - must be supplied.  The  `@'  character,
                leading  the host specification, is always required; as is the
                `:', leading the port specification.  Specify either  hostname
                or  hostaddr.  Specify either service name list or port number
                list.  If a service name list is specified, the  protocol  may
                also  need  to  be  specified if the TCP, UDP and UDPLITE port
                numbers for the service name are different.  Use  any  case  -
                lower or upper - for protocol.

                Service names and port numbers may be combined in a list whose
                entries are separated by commas and whose  numeric  range  en-
                tries  are separated by minus signs.  There may be no embedded
                spaces, and all service names must  belong  to  the  specified
                protocol.   Since  service  names  may  contain embedded minus
                signs, the starting entry of a range can't be a service  name;
                it can be a port number, however.

                Here are some sample addresses:

                     -i6 - IPv6 only
                     TCP:25 - TCP and port 25
                     @1.2.3.4 - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4
                     @[3ffe:1ebc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address
                          3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234
                     UDP:who - UDP who service port
                     TCP@lsof.itap:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap
                     tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10,
                          service name smtp, port 99, host name foo
                     tcp@bar:1-smtp - TCP, ports 1 through smtp, host bar
                     :time - either TCP, UDP or UDPLITE time service port

       -K k     selects  the  listing  of tasks (threads) of processes, on di-
                alects where task (thread) reporting is supported.   (If  help
                output  -  i.e.,  the  output of the -h or -?  options - shows
                this option, then task (thread) reporting is supported by  the
                dialect.)

                If  -K  is  followed  by  a  value, k, it must be ``i''.  That
                causes lsof to ignore  tasks,  particularly  in  the  default,
                list-everything case when no other options are specified.

                When -K and -a are both specified on Linux, and the tasks of a
                main process are selected by other options, the  main  process
                will  also  be  listed as though it were a task, but without a
                task ID.  (See the description of the TID column in the OUTPUT
                section.)

                Where  the  FreeBSD version supports threads, all threads will
                be listed with their IDs.

                In general threads and tasks inherit the files of the  caller,
                but may close some and open others, so lsof always reports all
                the open files of threads and tasks.

       -k k     specifies a kernel name list file, k,  in  place  of  /vmunix,
                /mach,  etc.   -k  is  not  available  under  AIX  on  the IBM
                RISC/System 6000.

       -l       inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to login names.  It
                is also useful when login name lookup is working improperly or
                slowly.

       +|-L [l] enables (`+') or disables  (`-')  the  listing  of  file  link
                counts, where they are available - e.g., they aren't available
                for sockets, or most FIFOs and pipes.

                When +L is specified without  a  following  number,  all  link
                counts will be listed.  When -L is specified (the default), no
                link counts will be listed.

                When +L is followed by a number,  only  files  having  a  link
                count  less  than  that number will be listed.  (No number may
                follow -L.)  A specification of the form ``+L1''  will  select
                open  files  that  have been unlinked.  A specification of the
                form ``+aL1 <file_system>'' will select unlinked open files on
                the specified file system.

                For  other link count comparisons, use field output (-F) and a
                post-processing script or program.

       +|-m m   specifies an alternate kernel memory file or  activates  mount
                table supplement processing.

                The  option  form  -m  m specifies a kernel memory file, m, in
                place of /dev/kmem or /dev/mem - e.g., a crash dump file.

                The option form +m requests that a mount  supplement  file  be
                written  to  the  standard output file.  All other options are
                silently ignored.

                There will be a line in the mount  supplement  file  for  each
                mounted file system, containing the mounted file system direc-
                tory, followed by a single space, followed by the device  num-
                ber in hexadecimal "0x" format - e.g.,

                     / 0x801

                Lsof  can  use the mount supplement file to get device numbers
                for file systems  when  it  can't  get  them  via  stat(2)  or
                lstat(2).

                The option form +m m identifies m as a mount supplement file.

                Note:  the  +m and +m m options are not available for all sup-
                ported dialects.  Check the output of lsof's -h or -?  options
                to see if the +m and +m m options are available.

       +|-M     Enables (+) or disables (-) the reporting of portmapper regis-
                trations for local TCP, UDP and UDPLITE ports, where port map-
                ping is supported.  (See the last paragraph of this option de-
                scription for information about where portmapper  registration
                reporting is supported.)

                The default reporting mode is set by the lsof builder with the
                HASPMAPENABLED #define in the dialect's machine.h header file;
                lsof  is  distributed  with the HASPMAPENABLED #define deacti-
                vated, so portmapper reporting is disabled by default and must
                be requested with +M.  Specifying lsof's -h or -?  option will
                report the default mode.   Disabling  portmapper  registration
                when  it  is  already disabled or enabling it when already en-
                abled is acceptable.  When portmapper  registration  reporting
                is enabled, lsof displays the portmapper registration (if any)
                for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in square brackets immedi-
                ately  following  the  port  numbers  or service names - e.g.,
                ``:1234[name]'' or ``:name[100083]''.  The registration infor-
                mation  may  be a name or number, depending on what the regis-
                tering program supplied to the portmapper when  it  registered
                the port.

                When  portmapper  registration  reporting is enabled, lsof may
                run a little more slowly or even become blocked when access to
                the  portmapper becomes congested or stopped.  Reverse the re-
                porting mode to determine if portmapper registration reporting
                is slowing or blocking lsof.

                For purposes of portmapper registration reporting lsof consid-
                ers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port local if: it is  found  in  the
                local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is lo-
                cated in the foreign part of its containing  kernel  structure
                and  the local and foreign Internet addresses are the same; or
                if it is located in the foreign part of its containing  kernel
                structure  and the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK
                (127.0.0.1).  This rule may  make  lsof  ignore  some  foreign
                ports  on  machines  with multiple interfaces when the foreign
                Internet address is on a different interface  from  the  local
                one.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for
                further discussion of portmapper  registration  reporting  is-
                sues.

                Portmapper  registration  reporting  is  supported only on di-
                alects that have RPC header files.  (Some Linux  distributions
                with  GlibC 2.14 do not have them.)  When portmapper registra-
                tion reporting is supported, the -h or -?   help  output  will
                show the +|-M option.

       -n       inhibits  the  conversion of network numbers to host names for
                network  files.   Inhibiting  conversion  may  make  lsof  run
                faster.   It is also useful when host name lookup is not work-
                ing properly.

       -N       selects the listing of NFS files.

       -o       directs lsof to display file offset at all times.   It  causes
                the  SIZE/OFF  output  column  title  to be changed to OFFSET.
                Note: on some UNIX dialects lsof can't obtain accurate or con-
                sistent  file offset information from its kernel data sources,
                sometimes just for particular kinds  of  files  (e.g.,  socket
                files.)  Consult the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its loca-
                tion.)  for more information.

                The -o and -s options are mutually exclusive; they can't  both
                be  specified.  When neither is specified, lsof displays what-
                ever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for
                the type of the file.

       -o o     defines  the  number of decimal digits (o) to be printed after
                the ``0t'' for a file offset before the form  is  switched  to
                ``0x...''.  An o value of zero (unlimited) directs lsof to use
                the ``0t'' form for all offset output.

                This option does NOT direct lsof  to  display  offset  at  all
                times;  specify -o (without a trailing number) to do that.  -o
                o only specifies the number of digits after ``0t''  in  either
                mixed  size and offset or offset-only output.  Thus, for exam-
                ple, to direct lsof to display offset at all times with a dec-
                imal digit count of 10, use:

                     -o -o 10
                or
                     -oo10

                The  default number of digits allowed after ``0t'' is normally
                8, but may have been changed by the lsof builder.  Consult the
                description  of  the -o o option in the output of the -h or -?
                option to determine the default that is in effect.

       -O       directs lsof to bypass the strategy it  uses  to  avoid  being
                blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked
                child processes.  See the BLOCKS  AND  TIMEOUTS  and  AVOIDING
                KERNEL  BLOCKS  sections for more information on kernel opera-
                tions that may block lsof.

                While use of this option will reduce lsof startup overhead, it
                may also cause lsof to hang when the kernel doesn't respond to
                a function.  Use this option cautiously.

       -p s     excludes or selects the listing of  files  for  the  processes
                whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the
                comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.  (There
                should be no spaces in the set.)

                PID  numbers  that  begin with `^' (negation) represent exclu-
                sions.

                Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a  single  ORed  set
                before  participating  in  AND option selection.  However, PID
                exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect
                before other selection criteria are applied.

       -P       inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for net-
                work files.  Inhibiting the conversion may  make  lsof  run  a
                little faster.  It is also useful when port name lookup is not
                working properly.

       -Q       ignore failed search terms. When lsof is told  to  search  for
                users  of  a file, or for users of a device, or for a specific
                PID, or for certain protocols in use by that PID, and  so  on,
                lsof  will  return  an  error if any of the search results are
                empty. The -Q option will change this behavior  so  that  lsof
                will  instead return a successful exit code (0) even if any of
                the search results are  empty.  In  addition,  missing  search
                terms will not be reported to stderr.

       +|-r [t[c<N>][m<fmt>]]
                puts  lsof in repeat mode.  There lsof lists open files as se-
                lected by other options, delays t seconds  (default  fifteen),
                then  repeats  the  listing, delaying and listing repetitively
                until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the  op-
                tion.

                If  the prefix is a `-', repeat mode is endless.  Lsof must be
                terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.   `c<N>'  is  for
                specifying  the  limits  of repeating; if the number of itera-
                tions reaches at `<N>', Lsof stops itself.

                If the prefix is `+', repeat mode will end the first cycle  no
                open  files  are  listed  - and of course when lsof is stopped
                with an interrupt or quit signal.  When repeat mode  ends  be-
                cause  no files are listed, the process exit code will be zero
                if any open files were ever listed; one,  if  none  were  ever
                listed.

                Lsof  marks  the  end  of  each listing: if field output is in
                progress (the -F, option  has  been  specified),  the  default
                marker  is  `m'; otherwise the default marker is ``========''.
                The marker is followed by a NL character.

                The optional "m<fmt>" argument  specifies  a  format  for  the
                marker  line.   The  <fmt> characters following `m' are inter-
                preted as a format specification to the strftime(3)  function,
                when  both  it  and the localtime(3) function are available in
                the dialect's C library.  Consult the  strftime(3)  documenta-
                tion  for  what  may appear in its format specification.  Note
                that when field output is requested with the -F option,  <fmt>
                cannot  contain  the  NL  format, ``%n''.  Note also that when
                <fmt> contains spaces or  other  characters  that  affect  the
                shell's  interpretation of arguments, <fmt> must be quoted ap-
                propriately.

                Repeat mode reduces lsof startup overhead, so it is more effi-
                cient  to  use this mode than to call lsof repetitively from a
                shell script, for example.

                To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany +|-r with spec-
                ification  of  other  lsof selection options, so the amount of
                kernel memory access lsof does will be kept to a minimum.  Op-
                tions  that filter at the process level - e.g., -c, -g, -p, -u
                - are the most efficient selectors.

                Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see  the
                -F,  option description) and a supervising awk or Perl script,
                or a C program.

       -R       directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification  number
                in the PPID column.

       -s [p:s] s  alone  directs  lsof to display file size at all times.  It
                causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE.
                If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.

                The  optional  -s  p:s form is available only for selected di-
                alects, and only when the -h or -?  help output lists it.

                When the optional form is available, the s may be followed  by
                a  protocol  name  (p), either TCP or UDP, a colon (`:') and a
                comma-separated protocol state name list,  the  option  causes
                open  TCP  and UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s)
                are in the list (s) preceded by a `^'; or  included  if  their
                name(s) are not preceded by a `^'.

                Dialects  that support this option may support only one proto-
                col.  When an unsupported protocol  is  specified,  a  message
                will  be displayed indicating state names for the protocol are
                unavailable.

                When an inclusion list is defined,  only  network  files  with
                state  names  in  the list will be present in the lsof output.
                Thus, specifying one state name means that only network  files
                with that lone state name will be listed.

                Case  is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there
                may be no spaces and the colon (`:') separating  the  protocol
                name (p) and the state name list (s) is required.

                If  only  TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by
                the specified exclusions and inclusions, the -i option must be
                specified,  too.   If only a single protocol's files are to be
                listed, add its name as an argument to the -i option.

                For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN,
                use:

                     -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

                Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states ex-
                cept Idle, use:

                     -iUDP -sUDP:^Idle

                State names vary with UNIX dialects, so it's not  possible  to
                provide  a  complete  list.   Some common TCP state names are:
                CLOSED, IDLE, BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT,  SYN_RCDV,
                ESTABLISHED,   CLOSE_WAIT,   FIN_WAIT1,   CLOSING,   LAST_ACK,
                FIN_WAIT_2, and TIME_WAIT.  Two common UDP state names are Un-
                bound and Idle.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for
                more information on how to use protocol  state  exclusion  and
                inclusion, including examples.

                The -o (without a following decimal digit count) and -s option
                (without a following protocol and state name list)  are  mutu-
                ally exclusive; they can't both be specified.  When neither is
                specified, lsof displays whatever value - size or offset -  is
                appropriate and available for the type of file.

                Since some types of files don't have true sizes - sockets, FI-
                FOs, pipes, etc. - lsof displays for their sizes  the  content
                amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.

       -S [t]   specifies  an optional time-out seconds value for kernel func-
                tions - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) - that might other-
                wise  deadlock.   The  minimum for t is two; the default, fif-
                teen; when no value is specified, the default is used.

                See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS section for more information.

       -T [t]   controls the reporting of some TCP/TPI information,  also  re-
                ported  by  netstat(1),  following  the network addresses.  In
                normal output the information  appears  in  parentheses,  each
                item  except  TCP  or  TPI state name identified by a keyword,
                followed by `=', separated from others by a single space:

                     <TCP or TPI state name>
                     QR=<read queue length>
                     QS=<send queue length>
                     SO=<socket options and values>
                     SS=<socket states>
                     TF=<TCP flags and values>
                     WR=<window read length>
                     WW=<window write length>

                Not all values are reported for all UNIX dialects.  Items val-
                ues (when available) are reported after the item name and '='.

                When  the field output mode is in effect (See OUTPUT FOR OTHER
                PROGRAMS.)  each item appears as a field with  a  `T'  leading
                character.

                -T  with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI informa-
                tion reporting.

                -T with following characters selects the reporting of specific
                TCP/TPI information:

                     f    selects reporting of socket options,
                          states and values, and TCP flags and
                          values.
                     q    selects queue length reporting.
                     s    selects connection state reporting.
                     w    selects window size reporting.

                Not  all selections are enabled for some UNIX dialects.  State
                may be selected for all dialects and is reported  by  default.
                The -h or -?  help output for the -T option will show what se-
                lections may be used with the UNIX dialect.

                When -T is used to select information - i.e., it  is  followed
                by  one or more selection characters - the displaying of state
                is disabled by default, and it  must  be  explicitly  selected
                again  in  the characters following -T.  (In effect, then, the
                default is equivalent to -Ts.)  For example, if queue  lengths
                and state are desired, use -Tqs.

                Socket  options,  socket states, some socket values, TCP flags
                and one TCP value may be reported (when available in the  UNIX
                dialect)  in  the form of the names that commonly appear after
                SO_, so_, SS_, TCP_  and TF_ in the dialect's header  files  -
                most     often     <sys/socket.h>,    <sys/socketvar.h>    and
                <netinet/tcp_var.h>.  Consult those header files for the mean-
                ing of the flags, options, states and values.

                ``SO=''  precedes  socket  options and values; ``SS='', socket
                states; and ``TF='', TCP flags and values.

                If a flag or option has a value, the value will follow an  '='
                and   the   name   --  e.g.,  ``SO=LINGER=5'',  ``SO=QLIM=5'',
                ``TF=MSS=512''.  The following seven values may be reported:

                     Name
                     Reported  Description (Common Symbol)

                     KEEPALIVE keep alive time (SO_KEEPALIVE)
                     LINGER    linger time (SO_LINGER)
                     MSS       maximum segment size (TCP_MAXSEG)
                     PQLEN          partial listen queue connections
                     QLEN      established listen queue connections
                     QLIM      established listen queue limit
                     RCVBUF    receive buffer length (SO_RCVBUF)
                     SNDBUF    send buffer length (SO_SNDBUF)

                Details on what socket options and values, socket states,  and
                TCP  flags and values may be displayed for particular UNIX di-
                alects may be found in the answer to the  ``Why  doesn't  lsof
                report socket options, socket states, and TCP flags and values
                for my dialect?'' and ``Why doesn't lsof  report  the  partial
                listen  queue connection count for my dialect?''  questions in
                the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)   On  Linux
                this option also prints the state of UNIX domain sockets.

       -t       produce  terse  output  comprising  only  process  identifiers
                (without a header), so that it is  easy  to  use  programmati-
                cally. e.g.

                     # reload anything using old SSL
                     lsof -t /lib/*/libssl.so.* | xargs -r kill -HUP

                     # get list of processes and then iterate over them (Bash only)
                     mapfile -t pids < <(
                         lsof -wt /var/log/your.log
                     )
                     for pid in "${pids[@]}" ; do
                         your_command -p "$pid"
                     done

                The -t option implies the -w option.

       -u s     selects the listing of files for the user whose login names or
                user ID numbers are in  the  comma-separated  set  s  -  e.g.,
                ``abe'',  or  ``548,root''.  (There should be no spaces in the
                set.)

                Multiple login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single
                ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                If  a login name or user ID is preceded by a `^', it becomes a
                negation - i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or
                user ID will never be listed.  A negated login name or user ID
                selection is neither ANDed nor ORed with other selections;  it
                is applied before all other selections and absolutely excludes
                the listing of the files of the process.  For example, to  di-
                rect  lsof  to  exclude the listing of files belonging to root
                processes, specify ``-u^root'' or ``-u^0''.

       -U       selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.

       -v       selects the listing of lsof  version  information,  including:
                revision  number;  when  the  lsof binary was constructed; who
                constructed the binary and where; the  name  of  the  compiler
                used  to  construct the lsof binary; the version number of the
                compiler when readily available; the compiler and loader flags
                used  to  construct  the  lsof binary; and system information,
                typically the output of uname's -a option.

       -V       directs lsof to indicate the items it was asked  to  list  and
                failed to find - command names, file names, Internet addresses
                or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.

                When other options  are  ANDed  to  search  options,  or  com-
                pile-time options restrict the listing of some files, lsof may
                not report that it failed to find a search item when an  ANDed
                option or compile-time option prevents the listing of the open
                file containing the located search item.

                For example, ``lsof -V -iTCP@foobar -a -d 999'' may not report
                a  failure  to locate open files at ``TCP@foobar'' and may not
                list any, if none have a file descriptor  number  of  999.   A
                similar  situation  arises when HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECU-
                RITY are defined at compile time and they prevent the  listing
                of open files.

       +|-w     Enables  (+)  or  disables (-) the suppression of warning mes-
                sages.

                The lsof builder may choose to have warning messages  disabled
                or  enabled  by default.  The default warning message state is
                indicated in the output of the -h or  -?   option.   Disabling
                warning  messages  when  they are already disabled or enabling
                them when already enabled is acceptable.

                The -t option implies the -w option.

       -x [fl]  may accompany the +d and +D options to direct their processing
                to  cross  over symbolic links and|or file system mount points
                encountered when scanning the directory (+d) or directory tree
                (+D).

                If  -x  is  specified by itself without a following parameter,
                cross-over processing of both symbolic links and  file  system
                mount points is enabled.  Note that when -x is specified with-
                out a parameter, the next argument must begin with '-' or '+'.

                The optional 'f' parameter enables  file  system  mount  point
                cross-over  processing; 'l', symbolic link cross-over process-
                ing.

                The -x option may not be supplied without also supplying a  +d
                or +D option.

       -X       This is a dialect-specific option.

           AIX:
                This IBM AIX RISC/System 6000 option requests the reporting of
                executed text file and shared library references.

                WARNING: because this option uses the kernel readx() function,
                its  use  on  a  busy  AIX  system  might cause an application
                process to hang so completely that it can  neither  be  killed
                nor stopped.  I have never seen this happen or had a report of
                its happening, but I think there is a  remote  possibility  it
                could happen.

                By  default  use  of readx() is disabled.  On AIX 5L and above
                lsof may need setuid-root permission to  perform  the  actions
                this option requests.

                The  lsof builder may specify that the -X option be restricted
                to processes whose real UID is root.  If that has  been  done,
                the -X option will not appear in the -h or -?  help output un-
                less the real UID of the lsof process is  root.   The  default
                lsof  distribution allows any UID to specify -X, so by default
                it will appear in the help output.

                When AIX readx() use is disabled, lsof may not be able to  re-
                port  information for all text and loader file references, but
                it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel directory  search
                kernel error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.

                The readx() function, used by lsof or any other program to ac-
                cess some sections of kernel virtual memory, can  trigger  the
                Stale  Segment ID bug.  It can cause the kernel's dir_search()
                function to believe erroneously that part of an in-memory copy
                of  a file system directory has been zeroed.  Another applica-
                tion process, distinct from lsof, asking the kernel to  search
                the   directory   -   e.g.,  by  using  open(2)  -  can  cause
                dir_search() to loop forever,  thus  hanging  the  application
                process.

                Consult  the  lsof  FAQ  (The FAQ section gives its location.)
                and the 00README file of the lsof distribution for a more com-
                plete  description  of the Stale Segment ID bug, its APAR, and
                methods for defining readx() use when compiling lsof.

           Linux:
                This Linux option requests that lsof skip the reporting of in-
                formation  on  all  open  TCP,  UDP  and UDPLITE IPv4 and IPv6
                files.

                This Linux option is most useful when the system  has  an  ex-
                tremely  large  number of open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE files, the
                processing of whose  information  in  the  /proc/net/tcp*  and
                /proc/net/udp*  files  would  take lsof a long time, and whose
                reporting is not of interest.

                Use this option with care and only when you are sure that  the
                information  you  want  lsof  to display isn't associated with
                open TCP, UDP or UDPLITE socket files.

           Solaris 10 and above:
                This Solaris 10 and above option  requests  the  reporting  of
                cached  paths for files that have been deleted - i.e., removed
                with rm(1) or unlink(2).

                The cached path is followed by the  string  `` (deleted)''  to
                indicate  that  the path by which the file was opened has been
                deleted.

                Because intervening changes made to the path -  i.e.,  renames
                with mv(1) or rename(2) - are not recorded in the cached path,
                what lsof reports is only the  path  by  which  the  file  was
                opened, not its possibly different final path.

       -z [z]   specifies  how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is to be
                handled.

                Without a following argument - e.g., NO z - the option  speci-
                fies  that zone names are to be listed in the ZONE output col-
                umn.

                The -z option may be followed by a zone name, z.  That  causes
                lsof to list only open files for processes in that zone.  Mul-
                tiple -z z option and argument pairs may be specified to  form
                a list of named zones.  Any open file of any process in any of
                the zones will be listed, subject to other  conditions  speci-
                fied by other options and arguments.

       -Z [Z]   specifies how SELinux security contexts are to be handled.  It
                and 'Z' field output  character  support  are  inhibited  when
                SELinux  is  disabled in the running Linux kernel.  See OUTPUT
                FOR OTHER PROGRAMS for more information on the 'Z' field  out-
                put character.

                Without  a following argument - e.g., NO Z - the option speci-
                fies that security contexts are to  be  listed  in  the  SECU-
                RITY-CONTEXT output column.

                The  -Z  option may be followed by a wildcard security context
                name, Z.  That causes lsof to list only open  files  for  pro-
                cesses in that security context.  Multiple -Z Z option and ar-
                gument pairs may be specified to form a list of security  con-
                texts.   Any  open  file of any process in any of the security
                contexts will be listed, subject to other conditions specified
                by  other  options and arguments.  Note that Z can be A:B:C or
                *:B:C or A:B:* or *:*:C to match against the A:B:C context.

       --       The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the  end
                of  the  keyed options.  It may be used, for example, when the
                first file name begins with a minus sign.  It may also be used
                when  the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be
                signified by the presence of a minus sign in the following op-
                tion and before the start of the file names.

       names    These  are  path  names  of  specific files to list.  Symbolic
                links are resolved before use.  The first name  may  be  sepa-
                rated from the preceding options with the ``--'' option.

                If  a name is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the
                device of the file system, lsof will list all the  files  open
                on  the file system.  To be considered a file system, the name
                must match a mounted-on directory name in mount(8) output,  or
                match  the name of a block device associated with a mounted-on
                directory name.  The +|-f option may be used to force lsof  to
                consider a name a file system identifier (+f) or a simple file
                (-f).

                If name is a path to a directory that is  not  the  mounted-on
                directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regu-
                lar file is treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to  pro-
                cesses  that  have  it open as a file or as a process-specific
                directory, such as the root or current working directory.   To
                request that lsof look for open files inside a directory name,
                use the +d s and +D D options.

                If a name is the base name of a family of multiplexed files  -
                e.g,  AIX's  /dev/pt[cs]  -  lsof will list all the associated
                multiplexed  files  on  the  device  that  are  open  -  e.g.,
                /dev/pt[cs]/1, /dev/pt[cs]/2, etc.

                If  a  name  is  a  UNIX domain socket name, lsof will usually
                search for it by the characters of the name alone - exactly as
                it  is  specified  and is recorded in the kernel socket struc-
                ture.  (See the next paragraph for an exception to  that  rule
                for  Linux.)   Specifying  a relative path - e.g., ./file - in
                place of the file's absolute path - e.g.,  /tmp/file  -  won't
                work  because  lsof must match the characters you specify with
                what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.

                If a name is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case lsof
                is  able  to search for it by its device and inode number, al-
                lowing name to be a relative path.  The case requires that the
                absolute  path  --  i.e.,  one beginning with a slash ('/') be
                used by the process that created  the  socket,  and  hence  be
                stored  in  the /proc/net/unix file; and it requires that lsof
                be able to obtain the device and node numbers of both the  ab-
                solute  path in /proc/net/unix and name via successful stat(2)
                system calls.  When those conditions are  met,  lsof  will  be
                able to search for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it
                is is specified in name.  Thus, for example, if  the  path  is
                /dev/log, and an lsof search is initiated when the working di-
                rectory is /dev, then name could be ./log.

                If a name is none of the above, lsof will list any open  files
                whose device and inode match that of the specified path name.

                If  you  have also specified the -b option, the only names you
                may safely specify are file systems for which your mount table
                supplies  alternate  device  numbers.  See the AVOIDING KERNEL
                BLOCKS and ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS sections for more informa-
                tion.

                Multiple  file  names  are  joined in a single ORed set before
                participating in AND option selection.

COMMAND: pidof

DESCRIPTION: pidof - find the process ID of a running program

USAGE: pidof  [-s]  [-c]  [-n]  [-x] [-z] [-o omitpid[,omitpid...]]  [-o omit-
       pid[,omitpid...]...]  [-d sep] program [program...]

OPTIONS:
-s     Single shot - this instructs the program to only return one pid.

       -c     Only return process PIDs that are running with the same root di-
              rectory.  This option is ignored for  non-root  users,  as  they
              will  be unable to check the current root directory of processes
              they do not own.

       -n     Avoid stat(2) system function call on all binaries which are lo-
              cated  on network based file systems like NFS.  Instead of using
              this option the variable PIDOF_NETFS may be set and exported.

       -q     Do not display matched PIDs to standard out. Simply exit with  a
              status  of  true or false to indicate whether a matching PID was
              found.

       -x     Scripts too - this causes the program  to  also  return  process
              id's of shells running the named scripts.

       -z     Try  to  detect  processes which are stuck in zombie (Z) status.
              Usually these processes are skipped as trying to deal with  them
              can  cause  pidof  or  related  tools to hang. Note: In the past
              pidof would ignore processes in the uninterruptable  state  (D),
              unless  the  -z  flag was specified. This is no longer the case.
              The pidof program will find and report processes in the D  state
              whether -z is specified or not.

       -d sep Tells  pidof  to use sep as an output separator if more than one
              PID is shown. The default separator is a space.

       -o omitpid
              Tells pidof to omit processes with that process id. The  special
              pid  %PPID  can  be used to name the parent process of the pidof
              program, in other words the calling shell or shell script.

COMMAND: systemd-cgtop

DESCRIPTION: systemd-cgtop - Show top control groups by their resource usage

USAGE: systemd-cgtop [OPTIONS...] [GROUP]

OPTIONS:
The following options are understood:

       -p, --order=path
           Order by control group path name.

       -t, --order=tasks
           Order by number of tasks/processes in the control group.

       -c, --order=cpu
           Order by CPU load.

       -m, --order=memory
           Order by memory usage.

       -i, --order=io
           Order by disk I/O load.

       -b, --batch
           Run in "batch" mode: do not accept input and run until the
           iteration limit set with --iterations= is exhausted or until
           killed. This mode could be useful for sending output from
           systemd-cgtop to other programs or to a file.

       -r, --raw
           Format byte counts (as in memory usage and I/O metrics) and CPU
           time with raw numeric values rather than human-readable numbers.

       --cpu=percentage, --cpu=time
           Controls whether the CPU usage is shown as percentage or time. By
           default, the CPU usage is shown as percentage. This setting may
           also be toggled at runtime by pressing the % key.

       -P
           Count only userspace processes instead of all tasks. By default,
           all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each userspace thread
           individually. With this setting, kernel threads are excluded from
           the count and each userspace process only counts as one task,
           regardless of how many threads it consists of. This setting may
           also be toggled at runtime by pressing the P key. This option may
           not be combined with -k.

       -k
           Count only userspace processes and kernel threads instead of all
           tasks. By default, all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and
           each userspace thread individually. With this setting, kernel
           threads are included in the count and each userspace process only
           counts as one task, regardless of how many threads it consists of.
           This setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the k key.
           This option may not be combined with -P.

       --recursive=
           Controls whether the number of processes shown for a control group
           shall include all processes that are contained in any of the child
           control groups as well. Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to
           "yes". If enabled, the processes in child control groups are
           included, if disabled, only the processes in the control group
           itself are counted. This setting may also be toggled at runtime by
           pressing the r key. Note that this setting only applies to process
           counting, i.e. when the -P or -k options are used. It has not
           effect if all tasks are counted, in which case the counting is
           always recursive.

       -n, --iterations=
           Perform only this many iterations. A value of 0 indicates that the
           program should run indefinitely.

       -1
           A shortcut for --iterations=1.

       -d, --delay=
           Specify refresh delay in seconds (or if one of "ms", "us", "min" is
           specified as unit in this time unit). This setting may also be
           increased and decreased at runtime by pressing the + and - keys.

       --depth=
           Maximum control group tree traversal depth. Specifies how deep
           systemd-cgtop shall traverse the control group hierarchies. If 0 is
           specified, only the root group is monitored. For 1, only the first
           level of control groups is monitored, and so on. Defaults to 3.

       -M MACHINE, --machine=MACHINE
           Limit control groups shown to the part corresponding to the
           container MACHINE. This option may not be used when a control group
           path is specified.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

COMMAND: journalctl

DESCRIPTION: journalctl - Query the systemd journal

USAGE: journalctl [OPTIONS...] [MATCHES...]

OPTIONS:
The following options control where to read journal records from:

       --system, --user
           Show messages from system services and the kernel (with --system).
           Show messages from service of current user (with --user). If
           neither is specified, show all messages that the user can see.

           The --user option affects how --unit arguments are treated. See
           --unit.

       -M, --machine=
           Show messages from a running, local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to.

       -m, --merge
           Show entries interleaved from all available journals, including
           remote ones.

       -D DIR, --directory=DIR
           Takes a directory path as argument. If specified, journalctl will
           operate on the specified journal directory DIR instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths.

       --file=GLOB
           Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, journalctl will
           operate on the specified journal files matching GLOB instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths. May be specified multiple
           times, in which case files will be suitably interleaved.

       --root=ROOT
           Takes a directory path as an argument. If specified, journalctl
           will operate on journal directories and catalog file hierarchy
           underneath the specified directory instead of the root directory
           (e.g.  --update-catalog will create
           ROOT/var/lib/systemd/catalog/database, and journal files under
           ROOT/run/journal/ or ROOT/var/log/journal/ will be displayed).

       --image=IMAGE
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, journalctl will operate on the file system in the
           indicated disk image. This option is similar to --root=, but
           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block devices,
           thus providing an easy way to extract log data from disk images.
           The disk image should either contain just a file system or a set of
           file systems within a GPT partition table, following the
           Discoverable Partitions Specification[1]. For further information
           on supported disk images, see systemd-nspawn(1)'s switch of the
           same name.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
           Takes a journal namespace identifier string as argument. If not
           specified the data collected by the default namespace is shown. If
           specified shows the log data of the specified namespace instead. If
           the namespace is specified as "*" data from all namespaces is
           shown, interleaved. If the namespace identifier is prefixed with
           "+" data from the specified namespace and the default namespace is
           shown, interleaved, but no other. For details about journal
           namespaces see systemd-journald.service(8).

COMMAND: journalctl

DESCRIPTION: journalctl - Query the systemd journal

USAGE: journalctl [OPTIONS...] [MATCHES...]

OPTIONS:
The following options control where to read journal records from:

       --system, --user
           Show messages from system services and the kernel (with --system).
           Show messages from service of current user (with --user). If
           neither is specified, show all messages that the user can see.

           The --user option affects how --unit arguments are treated. See
           --unit.

       -M, --machine=
           Show messages from a running, local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to.

       -m, --merge
           Show entries interleaved from all available journals, including
           remote ones.

       -D DIR, --directory=DIR
           Takes a directory path as argument. If specified, journalctl will
           operate on the specified journal directory DIR instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths.

       --file=GLOB
           Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, journalctl will
           operate on the specified journal files matching GLOB instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths. May be specified multiple
           times, in which case files will be suitably interleaved.

       --root=ROOT
           Takes a directory path as an argument. If specified, journalctl
           will operate on journal directories and catalog file hierarchy
           underneath the specified directory instead of the root directory
           (e.g.  --update-catalog will create
           ROOT/var/lib/systemd/catalog/database, and journal files under
           ROOT/run/journal/ or ROOT/var/log/journal/ will be displayed).

       --image=IMAGE
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, journalctl will operate on the file system in the
           indicated disk image. This option is similar to --root=, but
           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block devices,
           thus providing an easy way to extract log data from disk images.
           The disk image should either contain just a file system or a set of
           file systems within a GPT partition table, following the
           Discoverable Partitions Specification[1]. For further information
           on supported disk images, see systemd-nspawn(1)'s switch of the
           same name.

       --namespace=NAMESPACE
           Takes a journal namespace identifier string as argument. If not
           specified the data collected by the default namespace is shown. If
           specified shows the log data of the specified namespace instead. If
           the namespace is specified as "*" data from all namespaces is
           shown, interleaved. If the namespace identifier is prefixed with
           "+" data from the specified namespace and the default namespace is
           shown, interleaved, but no other. For details about journal
           namespaces see systemd-journald.service(8).

       --system, --user
           Show messages from system services and the kernel (with --system).
           Show messages from service of current user (with --user). If
           neither is specified, show all messages that the user can see.

           The --user option affects how --unit arguments are treated. See

       -M, --machine=
           Show messages from a running, local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to.

       -m, --merge
           Show entries interleaved from all available journals, including
           remote ones.

       -D DIR, --directory=DIR
           Takes a directory path as argument. If specified, journalctl will
           operate on the specified journal directory DIR instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths.

       --file=GLOB
           Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, journalctl will
           operate on the specified journal files matching GLOB instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths. May be specified multiple

       --root=ROOT
           Takes a directory path as an argument. If specified, journalctl
           will operate on journal directories and catalog file hierarchy
           underneath the specified directory instead of the root directory
           (e.g.  --update-catalog will create
           ROOT/var/lib/systemd/catalog/database, and journal files under
           ROOT/run/journal/ or ROOT/var/log/journal/ will be displayed).

       --image=IMAGE
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If

COMMAND: lsof

DESCRIPTION: lsof - list open files

USAGE: lsof  [  -?abChlnNOPQRtUvVX  ]  [ -A A ] [ -c c ] [ +c c ] [ +|-d d ] [
       +|-D D ] [ +|-e s ] [ +|-E ] [ +|-f [cfgGn] ] [ -F [f] ] [ -g [s]  ]  [
       -i  [i] ] [ -k k ] [ -K k ] [ +|-L [l] ] [ +|-m m ] [ +|-M ] [ -o [o] ]
       [ -p s ] [ +|-r [t[m<fmt>]] ] [ -s [p:s] ] [ -S [t] ] [ -T [t] ] [ -u s
       ] [ +|-w ] [ -x [fl] ] [ -z [z] ] [ -Z [Z] ] [ -- ] [names]

OPTIONS:
In the absence of any options, lsof lists all open files  belonging  to
       all active processes.

       If  any  list  request option is specified, other list requests must be
       specifically requested - e.g., if -U is specified for  the  listing  of
       UNIX  socket  files, NFS files won't be listed unless -N is also speci-
       fied; or if a user list is specified with the -u  option,  UNIX  domain
       socket  files,  belonging to users not in the list, won't be listed un-
       less the -U option is also specified.

       Normally, list options that are specifically stated are  ORed  -  i.e.,
       specifying  the  -i option without an address and the -ufoo option pro-
       duces a listing of all network files OR files  belonging  to  processes
       owned by user ``foo''.  The exceptions are:

       1) the `^' (negated) login name or user ID (UID), specified with the -u
          option;

       2) the `^' (negated) process ID (PID), specified with the -p option;

       3) the `^' (negated) process group ID (PGID), specified with the -g op-
          tion;

       4) the `^' (negated) command, specified with the -c option;

       5) the  (`^')  negated  TCP or UDP protocol state names, specified with
          the -s [p:s] option.

       Since they represent exclusions, they are applied without ORing or AND-
       ing and take effect before any other selection criteria are applied.

       The -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example, specify-
       ing -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that
       belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.

       Caution:  the  -a option causes all list selection options to be ANDed;
       it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options
       by  placing it between them, even though its placement there is accept-
       able.  Wherever -a is placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection op-
       tions.

       Items of the same selection set - command names, file descriptors, net-
       work addresses, process identifiers, user identifiers, zone names,  se-
       curity  contexts  -  are joined in a single ORed set and applied before
       the result participates  in  ANDing.   Thus,  for  example,  specifying
       -i@aaa.bbb,  -i@ccc.ddd,  -a,  and -ufff,ggg will select the listing of
       files that belong to either login ``fff'' OR ``ggg'' AND  have  network
       connections to either host aaa.bbb OR ccc.ddd.

       Options  may be grouped together following a single prefix -- e.g., the
       option set ``-a -b -C'' may be stated as -abC.  However,  since  values
       are optional following +|-f, -F, -g, -i, +|-L, -o, +|-r, -s, -S, -T, -x
       and -z.  when you have no values for them be careful that the following
       character isn't ambiguous.  For example, -Fn might represent the -F and
       -n options, or it might represent the n field identifier character fol-
       lowing  the  -F option.  When ambiguity is possible, start a new option
       with a `-' character - e.g., ``-F -n''.  If the next option is  a  file
       name,  follow the possibly ambiguous option with ``--'' - e.g., ``-F --
       name''.

       Either the `+' or the `-' prefix may be applied to a group of  options.
       Options that don't take on separate meanings for each prefix - e.g., -i
       - may be grouped under either prefix.  Thus, for example, ``+M -i'' may
       be  stated  as ``+Mi'' and the group means the same as the separate op-
       tions.  Be careful of prefix grouping when one or more options  in  the
       group  does  take on separate meanings under different prefixes - e.g.,
       +|-M; ``-iM'' is not the same request as ``-i +M''.  When in doubt, use
       separate options with appropriate prefixes.

       -? -h    These  two  equivalent  options  select  a usage (help) output
                list.  Lsof displays a shortened form of this output  when  it
                detects  an  error in the options supplied to it, after it has
                displayed messages explaining each  error.   (Escape  the  `?'
                character as your shell requires.)

       -a       causes list selection options to be ANDed, as described above.

       -A A     is  available  on  systems configured for AFS whose AFS kernel
                code is implemented via dynamic modules.  It allows  the  lsof
                user  to  specify  A  as an alternate name list file where the
                kernel addresses of the dynamic modules might be  found.   See
                the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more
                information about dynamic modules, their symbols, and how they
                affect lsof.

       -b       causes  lsof  to  avoid  kernel  functions  that might block -
                lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).

                See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING  KERNEL  BLOCKS  sec-
                tions for information on using this option.

       -c c     selects  the listing of files for processes executing the com-
                mand that begins with the characters of c.  Multiple  commands
                may  be specified, using multiple -c options.  They are joined
                in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selec-
                tion.

                If  c begins with a `^', then the following characters specify
                a command name whose processes are to be ignored (excluded.)

                If c begins and ends with a slash ('/'),  the  characters  be-
                tween  the  slashes  are  interpreted as a regular expression.
                Shell meta-characters in the regular expression must be quoted
                to  prevent  their  interpretation  by the shell.  The closing
                slash may be followed by these modifiers:

                     b    the regular expression is a basic one.
                     i    ignore the case of letters.
                     x    the regular expression is an extended one
                          (default).

                See the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives  its  location.)   for
                more information on basic and extended regular expressions.

                The  simple  command  specification  is tested first.  If that
                test fails, the command regular expression is applied.  If the
                simple  command  test succeeds, the command regular expression
                test isn't made.  This may result in ``no  command  found  for
                regex:'' messages when lsof's -V option is specified.

       +c w     defines  the maximum number of initial characters of the name,
                supplied by the UNIX dialect, of the UNIX  command  associated
                with a process to be printed in the COMMAND column.  (The lsof
                default is nine.)

                Note that many UNIX dialects do not supply  all  command  name
                characters to lsof in the files and structures from which lsof
                obtains command name.  Often  dialects  limit  the  number  of
                characters  supplied  in  those  sources.   For example, Linux
                2.4.27 and Solaris 9 both limit  command  name  length  to  16
                characters.

                If w is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to lsof by
                the UNIX dialect will be printed.

                If w is less than the length of the column title, ``COMMAND'',
                it will be raised to that length.

       -C       disables  the  reporting  of any path name components from the
                kernel's name cache.  See the KERNEL NAME  CACHE  section  for
                more information.

       +d s     causes  lsof  to  search for all open instances of directory s
                and the files and directories it contains at  its  top  level.
                +d does NOT descend the directory tree, rooted at s.  The +D D
                option may be used to request a  full-descent  directory  tree
                search, rooted at directory D.

                Processing  of  the  +d  option does not follow symbolic links
                within s unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor
                does  it  search for open files on file system mount points on
                subdirectories of s unless the -x or  -x   f  option  is  also
                specified.

                Note:  the  authority  of the user of this option limits it to
                searching for files that the user has  permission  to  examine
                with the system stat(2) function.

       -d s     specifies  a list of file descriptors (FDs) to exclude from or
                include in the output listing.  The file descriptors are spec-
                ified  in  the  comma-separated  set  s  -  e.g., ``cwd,1,3'',
                ``^6,^2''.  (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                The list is an exclusion list if all entries of the set  begin
                with  `^'.   It  is  an inclusion list if no entry begins with
                `^'.  Mixed lists are not permitted.

                A file descriptor number range may be in the set  as  long  as
                neither  member  is  empty,  both members are numbers, and the
                ending member is larger than the starting one - e.g.,  ``0-7''
                or  ``3-10''.   Ranges  may be specified for exclusion if they
                have the `^' prefix - e.g., ``^0-7''  excludes  all  file  de-
                scriptors 0 through 7.

                Multiple  file  descriptor numbers are joined in a single ORed
                set before participating in AND option selection.

                When there are exclusion and inclusion  members  in  the  set,
                lsof  reports  them as errors and exits with a non-zero return
                code.

                See the description of File Descriptor (FD) output  values  in
                the  OUTPUT  section  for  more information on file descriptor
                names.

                fd is a pseudo file descriptor name for specifying  the  whole
                range of possible file descriptor numbers.  fd does not appear
                in FD column of output.

       +D D     causes lsof to search for all open instances  of  directory  D
                and  all the files and directories it contains to its complete
                depth.

                Processing of the +D option does  not  follow  symbolic  links
                within D unless the -x or -x  l option is also specified.  Nor
                does it search for open files on file system mount  points  on
                subdirectories  of  D  unless  the  -x or -x  f option is also
                specified.

                Note: the authority of the user of this option  limits  it  to
                searching  for  files  that the user has permission to examine
                with the system stat(2) function.

                Further note: lsof may process this option slowly and  require
                a large amount of dynamic memory to do it.  This is because it
                must descend the entire directory tree, rooted at  D,  calling
                stat(2)  for  each  file and directory, building a list of all
                the files it finds, and searching that list for a  match  with
                every  open  file.  When directory D is large, these steps can
                take a long time, so use this option prudently.

       -D D     directs lsof's use of the device cache file.  The use of  this
                option  is  sometimes  restricted.   See the DEVICE CACHE FILE
                section and the sections that follow it for  more  information
                on this option.

                -D  must be followed by a function letter; the function letter
                may optionally be followed by a path  name.   Lsof  recognizes
                these function letters:

                     ? - report device cache file paths
                     b - build the device cache file
                     i - ignore the device cache file
                     r - read the device cache file
                     u - read and update the device cache file

                The  b,  r,  and  u functions, accompanied by a path name, are
                sometimes restricted.  When these  functions  are  restricted,
                they  will not appear in the description of the -D option that
                accompanies -h or -?  option output.   See  the  DEVICE  CACHE
                FILE section and the sections that follow it for more informa-
                tion on these functions and when they're restricted.

                The ?  function reports the read-only  and  write  paths  that
                lsof can use for the device cache file, the names of any envi-
                ronment variables whose values lsof will examine when  forming
                the  device  cache  file path, and the format for the personal
                device cache file path.  (Escape the  `?'  character  as  your
                shell requires.)

                When  available,  the b, r, and u functions may be followed by
                the  device  cache  file's  path.   The  standard  default  is
                .lsof_hostname  in the home directory of the real user ID that
                executes lsof, but this could have been changed when lsof  was
                configured  and  compiled.   (The output of the -h and -?  op-
                tions show the current default prefix - e.g., ``.lsof''.)  The
                suffix,  hostname,  is  the first component of the host's name
                returned by gethostname(2).

                When available, the b function directs lsof to build a new de-
                vice cache file at the default or specified path.

                The i function directs lsof to ignore the default device cache
                file and obtain its information about devices via direct calls
                to the kernel.

                The  r  function  directs lsof to read the device cache at the
                default or specified path, but prevents it from creating a new
                device  cache file when none exists or the existing one is im-
                properly structured.  The r function, when specified without a
                path  name,  prevents  lsof from updating an incorrect or out-
                dated device cache file, or creating a new one in  its  place.
                The  r function is always available when it is specified with-
                out a path name argument; it may be restricted by the  permis-
                sions of the lsof process.

                When available, the u function directs lsof to read the device
                cache file at the default or specified path, if possible,  and
                to rebuild it, if necessary.  This is the default device cache
                file function when no -D option has been specified.

       +|-e s   exempts the file system whose path name is s from  being  sub-
                jected  to kernel function calls that might block.  The +e op-
                tion exempts stat(2), lstat(2)  and  most  readlink(2)  kernel
                function  calls.   The  -e  option  exempts  only  stat(2) and
                lstat(2) kernel function calls.  Multiple file systems may  be
                specified  with separate +|-e specifications and each may have
                readlink(2) calls exempted or not.

                This option is currently implemented only for Linux.

                CAUTION: this option can easily be mis-applied to  other  than
                the  file system of interest, because it uses path name rather
                than the more reliable device and inode numbers.  (Device  and
                inode  numbers  are  acquired  via  the  potentially  blocking
                stat(2) kernel call and are thus not available,  but  see  the
                +|-m  m  option as a possible alternative way to supply device
                numbers.)  Use this option with great care and  fully  specify
                the path name of the file system to be exempted.

                When  open files on exempted file systems are reported, it may
                not be possible to obtain all their  information.   Therefore,
                some   information  columns  will  be  blank,  the  characters
                ``UNKN'' preface the values in the TYPE column, and the appli-
                cable  exemption  option is added in parentheses to the end of
                the NAME column.  (Some device  number  information  might  be
                made available via the +|-m m option.)

       +|-E     +E specifies that Linux pipe, Linux UNIX socket, Linux INET(6)
                socket closed in a local  host,  Linux  pseudoterminal  files,
                POSIX  Message  Queueue  implementation  in  Linux,  and Linux
                eventfd should be displayed with endpoint information and  the
                files of the endpoints should also be displayed.

                Note  1:  UNIX socket file endpoint information is only avail-
                able when the compile flags line of -v output contains  HASUX-
                SOCKEPT, and psudoterminal endpoint information is only avail-
                able when the compile flags line contains HASPTYEPT.

                Note 2: POSIX Message Queue file endpoint information is  only
                available when mqueue file system is mounted.

                Pipe  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME column in
                the form ``PID,cmd,FDmode'', where PID is the endpoint process
                ID;  cmd  is  the endpoint process command; FD is the endpoint
                file's descriptor; and mode  is  the  endpoint  file's  access
                mode.

                Pseudoterminal  endpoint  information is displayed in the NAME
                column as  ``->/dev/ptsmin PID,cmd,FDmode''  or  ``PID,cmd,FD-
                mode''.   The  first  form is for a master device; the second,
                for a slave device.  min is a slave device's minor device num-
                ber;  and PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe end-
                point information.  Note: psudoterminal  endpoint  information
                is  only  available  when  the compile flags line of -V output
                contains HASPTYEPT. In addition, this feature works  on  Linux
                kernels above 4.13.0.

                UNIX socket file endpoint information is displayed in the NAME
                column in the form
                ``type=TYPE ->INO=INODE PID,cmd,FDmode'', where  TYPE  is  the
                socket  type;  INODE  is  the  i-node  number of the connected
                socket; and PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same  as  with  pipe
                endpoint  information.  Note: UNIX socket file endpoint infor-
                mation is available only when the compile  flags  line  of  -v
                output contains HASUXSOCKEPT.

                INET socket file endpoint information is inserted to the value
                at the NAME column in th form
                PID, cmd, FD and mode are the same as with pipe  endpoint  in-
                formation.  The  endpoint information is available only if the
                socket is used for local IPC; both endpoints bind to the  same
                local IPv4 or IPv6 address.

                POSIX  Message Queue file endpoint information is displayed in
                the NAME column in the same form as that of pipe.

                eventfd endpoint information is displayed in the  NAME  column
                in  the same form as that of pipe. This feature works on Linux
                kernels above 5.2.0.

                Multiple occurrences of  this  information  can  appear  in  a
                file's NAME column.

                -E specifies that endpoint supported files should be displayed
                with endpoint information, but not the files of the endpoints.

       +|-f [cfgGn]
                f by itself clarifies how path name arguments are to be inter-
                preted.   When followed by c, f, g, G, or n in any combination
                it specifies that the listing of kernel file structure  infor-
                mation is to be enabled (`+') or inhibited (`-').

                Normally  a  path  name  argument is taken to be a file system
                name if it matches a mounted-on  directory  name  reported  by
                mount(8),  or  if  it  represents a block device, named in the
                mount output and associated with  a  mounted  directory  name.
                When +f is specified, all path name arguments will be taken to
                be file system names, and lsof will complain if any  are  not.
                This  can  be  useful,  for example, when the file system name
                (mounted-on device) isn't a block device.   This  happens  for
                some CD-ROM file systems.

                When  -f  is specified by itself, all path name arguments will
                be taken to be simple files.  Thus, for example,  the  ``-f --
                /''  arguments direct lsof to search for open files with a `/'
                path name, not all open files in the `/' (root) file system.

                Be careful to make sure +f and -f are properly terminated  and
                aren't followed by a character (e.g., of the file or file sys-
                tem name) that might be taken as a  parameter.   For  example,
                use ``--'' after +f and -f as in these examples.

                     $ lsof +f -- /file/system/name
                     $ lsof -f -- /file/name

                The  listing  of  information from kernel file structures, re-
                quested with the +f [cfgGn] option form,  is  normally  inhib-
                ited,  and is not available in whole or part for some dialects
                - e.g., /proc-based Linux kernels below 2.6.22.  When the pre-
                fix  to  f is a plus sign (`+'), these characters request file
                structure information:

                     c    file structure use count (not Linux)
                     f    file structure address (not Linux)
                     g    file flag abbreviations (Linux 2.6.22 and up)

                     G    file flags in hexadecimal (Linux 2.6.22 and up)
                     n    file structure node address (not Linux)

                When the prefix is minus (`-') the same characters disable the
                listing of the indicated values.

                File  structure  addresses,  use  counts,  flags, and node ad-
                dresses may be used to detect more readily identical files in-
                herited  by child processes and identical files in use by dif-
                ferent processes.  Lsof column output can be sorted by  output
                columns  holding  the  values and listed to identify identical
                file use, or lsof field output can be parsed by an AWK or Perl
                post-filter script, or by a C program.

       -F f     specifies  a  character list, f, that selects the fields to be
                output for processing by another program,  and  the  character
                that terminates each output field.  Each field to be output is
                specified with a single character in f.  The field  terminator
                defaults to NL, but may be changed to NUL (000).  See the OUT-
                PUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for a description of the  field
                identification characters and the field output process.

                When the field selection character list is empty, all standard
                fields are selected (except the  raw  device  field,  security
                context  and  zone field for compatibility reasons) and the NL
                field terminator is used.

                When the field selection character list contains only  a  zero
                (`0'),  all  fields  are selected (except the raw device field
                for compatibility reasons) and the NUL terminator character is
                used.

                Other combinations of fields and their associated field termi-
                nator character must be set with explicit entries in f, as de-
                scribed in the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section.

                When  a field selection character identifies an item lsof does
                not normally list - e.g., PPID, selected with -R -  specifica-
                tion of the field character - e.g., ``-FR'' - also selects the
                listing of the item.

                When the field selection character list  contains  the  single
                character  `?',  lsof  will  display  a help list of the field
                identification characters.  (Escape the `?' character as  your
                shell requires.)

       -g [s]   excludes  or  selects  the  listing of files for the processes
                whose optional process group IDentification (PGID) numbers are
                in  the comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.
                (There should be no spaces in the set.)

                PGID numbers that begin with `^' (negation)  represent  exclu-
                sions.

                Multiple  PGID  numbers are joined in a single ORed set before
                participating in AND option selection.  However,  PGID  exclu-
                sions  are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect be-
                fore other selection criteria are applied.

                The -g option also enables the output display of PGID numbers.
                When specified without a PGID set that's all it does.

       -i [i]   selects  the  listing  of  files any of whose Internet address
                matches the address specified in i.  If no address  is  speci-
                fied, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25
                (HP-UX) network files.

                If -i4 or -i6 is specified with  no  following  address,  only
                files  of  the  indicated  IP  version, IPv4 or IPv6, are dis-
                played.  (An IPv6 specification may be used only  if  the  di-
                alects supports IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]''
                in lsof's -h or -?   output.)   Sequentially  specifying  -i4,
                followed  by -i6 is the same as specifying -i, and vice-versa.
                Specifying -i4, or -i6 after -i is the same as specifying  -i4
                or -i6 by itself.

                Multiple  addresses  (up  to  a limit of 100) may be specified
                with multiple -i options.  (A  port  number  or  service  name
                range is counted as one address.)  They are joined in a single
                ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in  square
                brackets are optional.):

                [46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]

                where:
                     46 specifies the IP version, IPv4 or IPv6
                          that applies to the following address.
                          '6' may be be specified only if the UNIX
                          dialect supports IPv6.  If neither '4' nor
                          '6' is specified, the following address
                          applies to all IP versions.
                     protocol is a protocol name - TCP, UDP
                     hostname is an Internet host name.  Unless a
                          specific IP version is specified, open
                          network files associated with host names
                          of all versions will be selected.
                     hostaddr is a numeric Internet IPv4 address in
                          dot form; or an IPv6 numeric address in
                          colon form, enclosed in brackets, if the
                          UNIX dialect supports IPv6.  When an IP
                          version is selected, only its numeric
                          addresses may be specified.
                     service is an /etc/services name - e.g., smtp -
                          or a list of them.
                     port is a port number, or a list of them.

                IPv6  options  may  be  used only if the UNIX dialect supports
                IPv6.  To see if the dialect supports IPv6, run lsof and spec-
                ify the -h or -?  (help) option.  If the displayed description
                of the -i option contains ``[46]'' and  ``IPv[46]'',  IPv6  is
                supported.

                IPv4  host names and addresses may not be specified if network
                file selection is limited to IPv6 with -i 6.  IPv6 host  names
                and  addresses  may not be specified if network file selection
                is limited to IPv4 with -i  4.   When  an  open  IPv4  network
                file's  address  is mapped in an IPv6 address, the open file's
                type will be IPv6, not IPv4, and its display will be  selected
                by '6', not '4'.

                At  least  one  address  component - 4, 6, protocol, hostname,
                hostaddr, or service - must be supplied.  The  `@'  character,
                leading  the host specification, is always required; as is the
                `:', leading the port specification.  Specify either  hostname
                or  hostaddr.  Specify either service name list or port number
                list.  If a service name list is specified, the  protocol  may
                also  need  to  be  specified if the TCP, UDP and UDPLITE port
                numbers for the service name are different.  Use  any  case  -
                lower or upper - for protocol.

                Service names and port numbers may be combined in a list whose
                entries are separated by commas and whose  numeric  range  en-
                tries  are separated by minus signs.  There may be no embedded
                spaces, and all service names must  belong  to  the  specified
                protocol.   Since  service  names  may  contain embedded minus
                signs, the starting entry of a range can't be a service  name;
                it can be a port number, however.

                Here are some sample addresses:

                     -i6 - IPv6 only
                     TCP:25 - TCP and port 25
                     @1.2.3.4 - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4
                     @[3ffe:1ebc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address
                          3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234
                     UDP:who - UDP who service port
                     TCP@lsof.itap:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap
                     tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10,
                          service name smtp, port 99, host name foo
                     tcp@bar:1-smtp - TCP, ports 1 through smtp, host bar
                     :time - either TCP, UDP or UDPLITE time service port

       -K k     selects  the  listing  of tasks (threads) of processes, on di-
                alects where task (thread) reporting is supported.   (If  help
                output  -  i.e.,  the  output of the -h or -?  options - shows
                this option, then task (thread) reporting is supported by  the
                dialect.)

                If  -K  is  followed  by  a  value, k, it must be ``i''.  That
                causes lsof to ignore  tasks,  particularly  in  the  default,
                list-everything case when no other options are specified.

                When -K and -a are both specified on Linux, and the tasks of a
                main process are selected by other options, the  main  process
                will  also  be  listed as though it were a task, but without a
                task ID.  (See the description of the TID column in the OUTPUT
                section.)

                Where  the  FreeBSD version supports threads, all threads will
                be listed with their IDs.

                In general threads and tasks inherit the files of the  caller,
                but may close some and open others, so lsof always reports all
                the open files of threads and tasks.

       -k k     specifies a kernel name list file, k,  in  place  of  /vmunix,
                /mach,  etc.   -k  is  not  available  under  AIX  on  the IBM
                RISC/System 6000.

       -l       inhibits the conversion of user ID numbers to login names.  It
                is also useful when login name lookup is working improperly or
                slowly.

       +|-L [l] enables (`+') or disables  (`-')  the  listing  of  file  link
                counts, where they are available - e.g., they aren't available
                for sockets, or most FIFOs and pipes.

                When +L is specified without  a  following  number,  all  link
                counts will be listed.  When -L is specified (the default), no
                link counts will be listed.

                When +L is followed by a number,  only  files  having  a  link
                count  less  than  that number will be listed.  (No number may
                follow -L.)  A specification of the form ``+L1''  will  select
                open  files  that  have been unlinked.  A specification of the
                form ``+aL1 <file_system>'' will select unlinked open files on
                the specified file system.

                For  other link count comparisons, use field output (-F) and a
                post-processing script or program.

       +|-m m   specifies an alternate kernel memory file or  activates  mount
                table supplement processing.

                The  option  form  -m  m specifies a kernel memory file, m, in
                place of /dev/kmem or /dev/mem - e.g., a crash dump file.

                The option form +m requests that a mount  supplement  file  be
                written  to  the  standard output file.  All other options are
                silently ignored.

                There will be a line in the mount  supplement  file  for  each
                mounted file system, containing the mounted file system direc-
                tory, followed by a single space, followed by the device  num-
                ber in hexadecimal "0x" format - e.g.,

                     / 0x801

                Lsof  can  use the mount supplement file to get device numbers
                for file systems  when  it  can't  get  them  via  stat(2)  or
                lstat(2).

                The option form +m m identifies m as a mount supplement file.

                Note:  the  +m and +m m options are not available for all sup-
                ported dialects.  Check the output of lsof's -h or -?  options
                to see if the +m and +m m options are available.

       +|-M     Enables (+) or disables (-) the reporting of portmapper regis-
                trations for local TCP, UDP and UDPLITE ports, where port map-
                ping is supported.  (See the last paragraph of this option de-
                scription for information about where portmapper  registration
                reporting is supported.)

                The default reporting mode is set by the lsof builder with the
                HASPMAPENABLED #define in the dialect's machine.h header file;
                lsof  is  distributed  with the HASPMAPENABLED #define deacti-
                vated, so portmapper reporting is disabled by default and must
                be requested with +M.  Specifying lsof's -h or -?  option will
                report the default mode.   Disabling  portmapper  registration
                when  it  is  already disabled or enabling it when already en-
                abled is acceptable.  When portmapper  registration  reporting
                is enabled, lsof displays the portmapper registration (if any)
                for local TCP, UDP or UDPLITE ports in square brackets immedi-
                ately  following  the  port  numbers  or service names - e.g.,
                ``:1234[name]'' or ``:name[100083]''.  The registration infor-
                mation  may  be a name or number, depending on what the regis-
                tering program supplied to the portmapper when  it  registered
                the port.

                When  portmapper  registration  reporting is enabled, lsof may
                run a little more slowly or even become blocked when access to
                the  portmapper becomes congested or stopped.  Reverse the re-
                porting mode to determine if portmapper registration reporting
                is slowing or blocking lsof.

                For purposes of portmapper registration reporting lsof consid-
                ers a TCP, UDP or UDPLITE port local if: it is  found  in  the
                local part of its containing kernel structure; or if it is lo-
                cated in the foreign part of its containing  kernel  structure
                and  the local and foreign Internet addresses are the same; or
                if it is located in the foreign part of its containing  kernel
                structure  and the foreign Internet address is INADDR_LOOPBACK
                (127.0.0.1).  This rule may  make  lsof  ignore  some  foreign
                ports  on  machines  with multiple interfaces when the foreign
                Internet address is on a different interface  from  the  local
                one.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for
                further discussion of portmapper  registration  reporting  is-
                sues.

                Portmapper  registration  reporting  is  supported only on di-
                alects that have RPC header files.  (Some Linux  distributions
                with  GlibC 2.14 do not have them.)  When portmapper registra-
                tion reporting is supported, the -h or -?   help  output  will
                show the +|-M option.

       -n       inhibits  the  conversion of network numbers to host names for
                network  files.   Inhibiting  conversion  may  make  lsof  run
                faster.   It is also useful when host name lookup is not work-
                ing properly.

       -N       selects the listing of NFS files.

       -o       directs lsof to display file offset at all times.   It  causes
                the  SIZE/OFF  output  column  title  to be changed to OFFSET.
                Note: on some UNIX dialects lsof can't obtain accurate or con-
                sistent  file offset information from its kernel data sources,
                sometimes just for particular kinds  of  files  (e.g.,  socket
                files.)  Consult the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its loca-
                tion.)  for more information.

                The -o and -s options are mutually exclusive; they can't  both
                be  specified.  When neither is specified, lsof displays what-
                ever value - size or offset - is appropriate and available for
                the type of the file.

       -o o     defines  the  number of decimal digits (o) to be printed after
                the ``0t'' for a file offset before the form  is  switched  to
                ``0x...''.  An o value of zero (unlimited) directs lsof to use
                the ``0t'' form for all offset output.

                This option does NOT direct lsof  to  display  offset  at  all
                times;  specify -o (without a trailing number) to do that.  -o
                o only specifies the number of digits after ``0t''  in  either
                mixed  size and offset or offset-only output.  Thus, for exam-
                ple, to direct lsof to display offset at all times with a dec-
                imal digit count of 10, use:

                     -o -o 10
                or
                     -oo10

                The  default number of digits allowed after ``0t'' is normally
                8, but may have been changed by the lsof builder.  Consult the
                description  of  the -o o option in the output of the -h or -?
                option to determine the default that is in effect.

       -O       directs lsof to bypass the strategy it  uses  to  avoid  being
                blocked by some kernel operations - i.e., doing them in forked
                child processes.  See the BLOCKS  AND  TIMEOUTS  and  AVOIDING
                KERNEL  BLOCKS  sections for more information on kernel opera-
                tions that may block lsof.

                While use of this option will reduce lsof startup overhead, it
                may also cause lsof to hang when the kernel doesn't respond to
                a function.  Use this option cautiously.

       -p s     excludes or selects the listing of  files  for  the  processes
                whose optional process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the
                comma-separated set s - e.g., ``123'' or ``123,^456''.  (There
                should be no spaces in the set.)

                PID  numbers  that  begin with `^' (negation) represent exclu-
                sions.

                Multiple process ID numbers are joined in a  single  ORed  set
                before  participating  in  AND option selection.  However, PID
                exclusions are applied without ORing or ANDing and take effect
                before other selection criteria are applied.

       -P       inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for net-
                work files.  Inhibiting the conversion may  make  lsof  run  a
                little faster.  It is also useful when port name lookup is not
                working properly.

       -Q       ignore failed search terms. When lsof is told  to  search  for
                users  of  a file, or for users of a device, or for a specific
                PID, or for certain protocols in use by that PID, and  so  on,
                lsof  will  return  an  error if any of the search results are
                empty. The -Q option will change this behavior  so  that  lsof
                will  instead return a successful exit code (0) even if any of
                the search results are  empty.  In  addition,  missing  search
                terms will not be reported to stderr.

       +|-r [t[c<N>][m<fmt>]]
                puts  lsof in repeat mode.  There lsof lists open files as se-
                lected by other options, delays t seconds  (default  fifteen),
                then  repeats  the  listing, delaying and listing repetitively
                until stopped by a condition defined by the prefix to the  op-
                tion.

                If  the prefix is a `-', repeat mode is endless.  Lsof must be
                terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.   `c<N>'  is  for
                specifying  the  limits  of repeating; if the number of itera-
                tions reaches at `<N>', Lsof stops itself.

                If the prefix is `+', repeat mode will end the first cycle  no
                open  files  are  listed  - and of course when lsof is stopped
                with an interrupt or quit signal.  When repeat mode  ends  be-
                cause  no files are listed, the process exit code will be zero
                if any open files were ever listed; one,  if  none  were  ever
                listed.

                Lsof  marks  the  end  of  each listing: if field output is in
                progress (the -F, option  has  been  specified),  the  default
                marker  is  `m'; otherwise the default marker is ``========''.
                The marker is followed by a NL character.

                The optional "m<fmt>" argument  specifies  a  format  for  the
                marker  line.   The  <fmt> characters following `m' are inter-
                preted as a format specification to the strftime(3)  function,
                when  both  it  and the localtime(3) function are available in
                the dialect's C library.  Consult the  strftime(3)  documenta-
                tion  for  what  may appear in its format specification.  Note
                that when field output is requested with the -F option,  <fmt>
                cannot  contain  the  NL  format, ``%n''.  Note also that when
                <fmt> contains spaces or  other  characters  that  affect  the
                shell's  interpretation of arguments, <fmt> must be quoted ap-
                propriately.

                Repeat mode reduces lsof startup overhead, so it is more effi-
                cient  to  use this mode than to call lsof repetitively from a
                shell script, for example.

                To use repeat mode most efficiently, accompany +|-r with spec-
                ification  of  other  lsof selection options, so the amount of
                kernel memory access lsof does will be kept to a minimum.  Op-
                tions  that filter at the process level - e.g., -c, -g, -p, -u
                - are the most efficient selectors.

                Repeat mode is useful when coupled with field output (see  the
                -F,  option description) and a supervising awk or Perl script,
                or a C program.

       -R       directs lsof to list the Parent Process IDentification  number
                in the PPID column.

       -s [p:s] s  alone  directs  lsof to display file size at all times.  It
                causes the SIZE/OFF output column title to be changed to SIZE.
                If the file does not have a size, nothing is displayed.

                The  optional  -s  p:s form is available only for selected di-
                alects, and only when the -h or -?  help output lists it.

                When the optional form is available, the s may be followed  by
                a  protocol  name  (p), either TCP or UDP, a colon (`:') and a
                comma-separated protocol state name list,  the  option  causes
                open  TCP  and UDP files to be excluded if their state name(s)
                are in the list (s) preceded by a `^'; or  included  if  their
                name(s) are not preceded by a `^'.

                Dialects  that support this option may support only one proto-
                col.  When an unsupported protocol  is  specified,  a  message
                will  be displayed indicating state names for the protocol are
                unavailable.

                When an inclusion list is defined,  only  network  files  with
                state  names  in  the list will be present in the lsof output.
                Thus, specifying one state name means that only network  files
                with that lone state name will be listed.

                Case  is unimportant in the protocol or state names, but there
                may be no spaces and the colon (`:') separating  the  protocol
                name (p) and the state name list (s) is required.

                If  only  TCP and UDP files are to be listed, as controlled by
                the specified exclusions and inclusions, the -i option must be
                specified,  too.   If only a single protocol's files are to be
                listed, add its name as an argument to the -i option.

                For example, to list only network files with TCP state LISTEN,
                use:

                     -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN

                Or, for example, to list network files with all UDP states ex-
                cept Idle, use:

                     -iUDP -sUDP:^Idle

                State names vary with UNIX dialects, so it's not  possible  to
                provide  a  complete  list.   Some common TCP state names are:
                CLOSED, IDLE, BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, SYN_SENT,  SYN_RCDV,
                ESTABLISHED,   CLOSE_WAIT,   FIN_WAIT1,   CLOSING,   LAST_ACK,
                FIN_WAIT_2, and TIME_WAIT.  Two common UDP state names are Un-
                bound and Idle.

                See  the  lsof  FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)  for
                more information on how to use protocol  state  exclusion  and
                inclusion, including examples.

                The -o (without a following decimal digit count) and -s option
                (without a following protocol and state name list)  are  mutu-
                ally exclusive; they can't both be specified.  When neither is
                specified, lsof displays whatever value - size or offset -  is
                appropriate and available for the type of file.

                Since some types of files don't have true sizes - sockets, FI-
                FOs, pipes, etc. - lsof displays for their sizes  the  content
                amounts in their associated kernel buffers, if possible.

       -S [t]   specifies  an optional time-out seconds value for kernel func-
                tions - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2) - that might other-
                wise  deadlock.   The  minimum for t is two; the default, fif-
                teen; when no value is specified, the default is used.

                See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS section for more information.

       -T [t]   controls the reporting of some TCP/TPI information,  also  re-
                ported  by  netstat(1),  following  the network addresses.  In
                normal output the information  appears  in  parentheses,  each
                item  except  TCP  or  TPI state name identified by a keyword,
                followed by `=', separated from others by a single space:

                     <TCP or TPI state name>
                     QR=<read queue length>
                     QS=<send queue length>
                     SO=<socket options and values>
                     SS=<socket states>
                     TF=<TCP flags and values>
                     WR=<window read length>
                     WW=<window write length>

                Not all values are reported for all UNIX dialects.  Items val-
                ues (when available) are reported after the item name and '='.

                When  the field output mode is in effect (See OUTPUT FOR OTHER
                PROGRAMS.)  each item appears as a field with  a  `T'  leading
                character.

                -T  with no following key characters disables TCP/TPI informa-
                tion reporting.

                -T with following characters selects the reporting of specific
                TCP/TPI information:

                     f    selects reporting of socket options,
                          states and values, and TCP flags and
                          values.
                     q    selects queue length reporting.
                     s    selects connection state reporting.
                     w    selects window size reporting.

                Not  all selections are enabled for some UNIX dialects.  State
                may be selected for all dialects and is reported  by  default.
                The -h or -?  help output for the -T option will show what se-
                lections may be used with the UNIX dialect.

                When -T is used to select information - i.e., it  is  followed
                by  one or more selection characters - the displaying of state
                is disabled by default, and it  must  be  explicitly  selected
                again  in  the characters following -T.  (In effect, then, the
                default is equivalent to -Ts.)  For example, if queue  lengths
                and state are desired, use -Tqs.

                Socket  options,  socket states, some socket values, TCP flags
                and one TCP value may be reported (when available in the  UNIX
                dialect)  in  the form of the names that commonly appear after
                SO_, so_, SS_, TCP_  and TF_ in the dialect's header  files  -
                most     often     <sys/socket.h>,    <sys/socketvar.h>    and
                <netinet/tcp_var.h>.  Consult those header files for the mean-
                ing of the flags, options, states and values.

                ``SO=''  precedes  socket  options and values; ``SS='', socket
                states; and ``TF='', TCP flags and values.

                If a flag or option has a value, the value will follow an  '='
                and   the   name   --  e.g.,  ``SO=LINGER=5'',  ``SO=QLIM=5'',
                ``TF=MSS=512''.  The following seven values may be reported:

                     Name
                     Reported  Description (Common Symbol)

                     KEEPALIVE keep alive time (SO_KEEPALIVE)
                     LINGER    linger time (SO_LINGER)
                     MSS       maximum segment size (TCP_MAXSEG)
                     PQLEN          partial listen queue connections
                     QLEN      established listen queue connections
                     QLIM      established listen queue limit
                     RCVBUF    receive buffer length (SO_RCVBUF)
                     SNDBUF    send buffer length (SO_SNDBUF)

                Details on what socket options and values, socket states,  and
                TCP  flags and values may be displayed for particular UNIX di-
                alects may be found in the answer to the  ``Why  doesn't  lsof
                report socket options, socket states, and TCP flags and values
                for my dialect?'' and ``Why doesn't lsof  report  the  partial
                listen  queue connection count for my dialect?''  questions in
                the lsof FAQ (The FAQ section gives its location.)   On  Linux
                this option also prints the state of UNIX domain sockets.

       -t       produce  terse  output  comprising  only  process  identifiers
                (without a header), so that it is  easy  to  use  programmati-
                cally. e.g.

                     # reload anything using old SSL
                     lsof -t /lib/*/libssl.so.* | xargs -r kill -HUP

                     # get list of processes and then iterate over them (Bash only)
                     mapfile -t pids < <(
                         lsof -wt /var/log/your.log
                     )
                     for pid in "${pids[@]}" ; do
                         your_command -p "$pid"
                     done

                The -t option implies the -w option.

       -u s     selects the listing of files for the user whose login names or
                user ID numbers are in  the  comma-separated  set  s  -  e.g.,
                ``abe'',  or  ``548,root''.  (There should be no spaces in the
                set.)

                Multiple login names or user ID numbers are joined in a single
                ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                If  a login name or user ID is preceded by a `^', it becomes a
                negation - i.e., files of processes owned by the login name or
                user ID will never be listed.  A negated login name or user ID
                selection is neither ANDed nor ORed with other selections;  it
                is applied before all other selections and absolutely excludes
                the listing of the files of the process.  For example, to  di-
                rect  lsof  to  exclude the listing of files belonging to root
                processes, specify ``-u^root'' or ``-u^0''.

       -U       selects the listing of UNIX domain socket files.

       -v       selects the listing of lsof  version  information,  including:
                revision  number;  when  the  lsof binary was constructed; who
                constructed the binary and where; the  name  of  the  compiler
                used  to  construct the lsof binary; the version number of the
                compiler when readily available; the compiler and loader flags
                used  to  construct  the  lsof binary; and system information,
                typically the output of uname's -a option.

       -V       directs lsof to indicate the items it was asked  to  list  and
                failed to find - command names, file names, Internet addresses
                or files, login names, NFS files, PIDs, PGIDs, and UIDs.

                When other options  are  ANDed  to  search  options,  or  com-
                pile-time options restrict the listing of some files, lsof may
                not report that it failed to find a search item when an  ANDed
                option or compile-time option prevents the listing of the open
                file containing the located search item.

                For example, ``lsof -V -iTCP@foobar -a -d 999'' may not report
                a  failure  to locate open files at ``TCP@foobar'' and may not
                list any, if none have a file descriptor  number  of  999.   A
                similar  situation  arises when HASSECURITY and HASNOSOCKSECU-
                RITY are defined at compile time and they prevent the  listing
                of open files.

       +|-w     Enables  (+)  or  disables (-) the suppression of warning mes-
                sages.

                The lsof builder may choose to have warning messages  disabled
                or  enabled  by default.  The default warning message state is
                indicated in the output of the -h or  -?   option.   Disabling
                warning  messages  when  they are already disabled or enabling
                them when already enabled is acceptable.

                The -t option implies the -w option.

       -x [fl]  may accompany the +d and +D options to direct their processing
                to  cross  over symbolic links and|or file system mount points
                encountered when scanning the directory (+d) or directory tree
                (+D).

                If  -x  is  specified by itself without a following parameter,
                cross-over processing of both symbolic links and  file  system
                mount points is enabled.  Note that when -x is specified with-
                out a parameter, the next argument must begin with '-' or '+'.

                The optional 'f' parameter enables  file  system  mount  point
                cross-over  processing; 'l', symbolic link cross-over process-
                ing.

                The -x option may not be supplied without also supplying a  +d
                or +D option.

       -X       This is a dialect-specific option.

           AIX:
                This IBM AIX RISC/System 6000 option requests the reporting of
                executed text file and shared library references.

                WARNING: because this option uses the kernel readx() function,
                its  use  on  a  busy  AIX  system  might cause an application
                process to hang so completely that it can  neither  be  killed
                nor stopped.  I have never seen this happen or had a report of
                its happening, but I think there is a  remote  possibility  it
                could happen.

                By  default  use  of readx() is disabled.  On AIX 5L and above
                lsof may need setuid-root permission to  perform  the  actions
                this option requests.

                The  lsof builder may specify that the -X option be restricted
                to processes whose real UID is root.  If that has  been  done,
                the -X option will not appear in the -h or -?  help output un-
                less the real UID of the lsof process is  root.   The  default
                lsof  distribution allows any UID to specify -X, so by default
                it will appear in the help output.

                When AIX readx() use is disabled, lsof may not be able to  re-
                port  information for all text and loader file references, but
                it may also avoid exacerbating an AIX kernel directory  search
                kernel error, known as the Stale Segment ID bug.

                The readx() function, used by lsof or any other program to ac-
                cess some sections of kernel virtual memory, can  trigger  the
                Stale  Segment ID bug.  It can cause the kernel's dir_search()
                function to believe erroneously that part of an in-memory copy
                of  a file system directory has been zeroed.  Another applica-
                tion process, distinct from lsof, asking the kernel to  search
                the   directory   -   e.g.,  by  using  open(2)  -  can  cause
                dir_search() to loop forever,  thus  hanging  the  application
                process.

                Consult  the  lsof  FAQ  (The FAQ section gives its location.)
                and the 00README file of the lsof distribution for a more com-
                plete  description  of the Stale Segment ID bug, its APAR, and
                methods for defining readx() use when compiling lsof.

           Linux:
                This Linux option requests that lsof skip the reporting of in-
                formation  on  all  open  TCP,  UDP  and UDPLITE IPv4 and IPv6
                files.

                This Linux option is most useful when the system  has  an  ex-
                tremely  large  number of open TCP, UDP and UDPLITE files, the
                processing of whose  information  in  the  /proc/net/tcp*  and
                /proc/net/udp*  files  would  take lsof a long time, and whose
                reporting is not of interest.

                Use this option with care and only when you are sure that  the
                information  you  want  lsof  to display isn't associated with
                open TCP, UDP or UDPLITE socket files.

           Solaris 10 and above:
                This Solaris 10 and above option  requests  the  reporting  of
                cached  paths for files that have been deleted - i.e., removed
                with rm(1) or unlink(2).

                The cached path is followed by the  string  `` (deleted)''  to
                indicate  that  the path by which the file was opened has been
                deleted.

                Because intervening changes made to the path -  i.e.,  renames
                with mv(1) or rename(2) - are not recorded in the cached path,
                what lsof reports is only the  path  by  which  the  file  was
                opened, not its possibly different final path.

       -z [z]   specifies  how Solaris 10 and higher zone information is to be
                handled.

                Without a following argument - e.g., NO z - the option  speci-
                fies  that zone names are to be listed in the ZONE output col-
                umn.

                The -z option may be followed by a zone name, z.  That  causes
                lsof to list only open files for processes in that zone.  Mul-
                tiple -z z option and argument pairs may be specified to  form
                a list of named zones.  Any open file of any process in any of
                the zones will be listed, subject to other  conditions  speci-
                fied by other options and arguments.

       -Z [Z]   specifies how SELinux security contexts are to be handled.  It
                and 'Z' field output  character  support  are  inhibited  when
                SELinux  is  disabled in the running Linux kernel.  See OUTPUT
                FOR OTHER PROGRAMS for more information on the 'Z' field  out-
                put character.

                Without  a following argument - e.g., NO Z - the option speci-
                fies that security contexts are to  be  listed  in  the  SECU-
                RITY-CONTEXT output column.

                The  -Z  option may be followed by a wildcard security context
                name, Z.  That causes lsof to list only open  files  for  pro-
                cesses in that security context.  Multiple -Z Z option and ar-
                gument pairs may be specified to form a list of security  con-
                texts.   Any  open  file of any process in any of the security
                contexts will be listed, subject to other conditions specified
                by  other  options and arguments.  Note that Z can be A:B:C or
                *:B:C or A:B:* or *:*:C to match against the A:B:C context.

       --       The double minus sign option is a marker that signals the  end
                of  the  keyed options.  It may be used, for example, when the
                first file name begins with a minus sign.  It may also be used
                when  the absence of a value for the last keyed option must be
                signified by the presence of a minus sign in the following op-
                tion and before the start of the file names.

       names    These  are  path  names  of  specific files to list.  Symbolic
                links are resolved before use.  The first name  may  be  sepa-
                rated from the preceding options with the ``--'' option.

                If  a name is the mounted-on directory of a file system or the
                device of the file system, lsof will list all the  files  open
                on  the file system.  To be considered a file system, the name
                must match a mounted-on directory name in mount(8) output,  or
                match  the name of a block device associated with a mounted-on
                directory name.  The +|-f option may be used to force lsof  to
                consider a name a file system identifier (+f) or a simple file
                (-f).

                If name is a path to a directory that is  not  the  mounted-on
                directory name of a file system, it is treated just as a regu-
                lar file is treated - i.e., its listing is restricted to  pro-
                cesses  that  have  it open as a file or as a process-specific
                directory, such as the root or current working directory.   To
                request that lsof look for open files inside a directory name,
                use the +d s and +D D options.

                If a name is the base name of a family of multiplexed files  -
                e.g,  AIX's  /dev/pt[cs]  -  lsof will list all the associated
                multiplexed  files  on  the  device  that  are  open  -  e.g.,
                /dev/pt[cs]/1, /dev/pt[cs]/2, etc.

                If  a  name  is  a  UNIX domain socket name, lsof will usually
                search for it by the characters of the name alone - exactly as
                it  is  specified  and is recorded in the kernel socket struc-
                ture.  (See the next paragraph for an exception to  that  rule
                for  Linux.)   Specifying  a relative path - e.g., ./file - in
                place of the file's absolute path - e.g.,  /tmp/file  -  won't
                work  because  lsof must match the characters you specify with
                what it finds in the kernel UNIX domain socket structures.

                If a name is a Linux UNIX domain socket name, in one case lsof
                is  able  to search for it by its device and inode number, al-
                lowing name to be a relative path.  The case requires that the
                absolute  path  --  i.e.,  one beginning with a slash ('/') be
                used by the process that created  the  socket,  and  hence  be
                stored  in  the /proc/net/unix file; and it requires that lsof
                be able to obtain the device and node numbers of both the  ab-
                solute  path in /proc/net/unix and name via successful stat(2)
                system calls.  When those conditions are  met,  lsof  will  be
                able to search for the UNIX domain socket when some path to it
                is is specified in name.  Thus, for example, if  the  path  is
                /dev/log, and an lsof search is initiated when the working di-
                rectory is /dev, then name could be ./log.

                If a name is none of the above, lsof will list any open  files
                whose device and inode match that of the specified path name.

                If  you  have also specified the -b option, the only names you
                may safely specify are file systems for which your mount table
                supplies  alternate  device  numbers.  See the AVOIDING KERNEL
                BLOCKS and ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS sections for more informa-
                tion.

                Multiple  file  names  are  joined in a single ORed set before
                participating in AND option selection.

DESCRIPTION: cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

USAGE: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
COMMAND INPUT:
cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf 2>/dev/null

COMMAND OUTPUT:
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
# hints.
#
#
# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:
# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to
# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's
# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,
# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in
# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
# possible.

# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
#
#	/etc/apache2/
#	|-- apache2.conf
#	|	`--  ports.conf
#	|-- mods-enabled
#	|	|-- *.load
#	|	`-- *.conf
#	|-- conf-enabled
#	|	`-- *.conf
# 	`-- sites-enabled
#	 	`-- *.conf
#
#
# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
#   web server.
#
# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is
#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be
#   customized anytime.
#
# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/
#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,
#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,
#   respectively.
#
#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their
#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our
#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See
#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
#
# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in
#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with
#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not
#   work with the default configuration.


# Global configuration
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the Mutex documentation (available
# at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#mutex>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
#ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#
#Mutex file:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR} default

#
# The directory where shm and other runtime files will be stored.
#

DefaultRuntimeDir ${APACHE_RUN_DIR}

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
# This needs to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
#
PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 5


# These need to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
User ${APACHE_RUN_USER}
Group ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}

#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#
HostnameLookups Off

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

#
# LogLevel: Control the severity of messages logged to the error_log.
# Available values: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
# error, crit, alert, emerg.
# It is also possible to configure the log level for particular modules, e.g.
# "LogLevel info ssl:warn"

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About php.ini   ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for
; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.

; PHP attempts to find and load this configuration from a number of locations.
; The following is a summary of its search order:
; 1. SAPI module specific location.
; 2. The PHPRC environment variable.
; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows
; 4. Current working directory (except CLI)
; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP
; (otherwise in Windows)
; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the
; Windows directory (usually C:\windows)
; See the PHP docs for more specific information.
; https://php.net/configuration.file

; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and lines
; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though
; they might mean something in the future.

; Directives following the section heading [PATH=/www/mysite] only
; apply to PHP files in the /www/mysite directory.  Directives
; following the section heading [HOST=www.example.com] only apply to
; PHP files served from www.example.com.  Directives set in these
; special sections cannot be overridden by user-defined INI files or
; at runtime. Currently, [PATH=] and [HOST=] sections only work under
; CGI/FastCGI.
; https://php.net/ini.sections

; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
; directive = value
; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
; Directives are variables used to configure PHP or PHP extensions.
; There is no name validation.  If PHP can't find an expected
; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value will be used.

; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one
; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression
; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), a quoted string ("bar"), or a reference to a
; previously set variable or directive (e.g. ${foo})

; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:
; |  bitwise OR
; ^  bitwise XOR
; &  bitwise AND
; ~  bitwise NOT
; !  boolean NOT

; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.
; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.

; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
; sign, or by using the None keyword:

; foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
; foo = None    ; sets foo to an empty string
; foo = "None"  ; sets foo to the string 'None'

; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a
; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),
; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About this file ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; PHP comes packaged with two INI files. One that is recommended to be used
; in production environments and one that is recommended to be used in
; development environments.

; php.ini-production contains settings which hold security, performance and
; best practices at its core. But please be aware, these settings may break
; compatibility with older or less security-conscious applications. We
; recommending using the production ini in production and testing environments.

; php.ini-development is very similar to its production variant, except it is
; much more verbose when it comes to errors. We recommend using the
; development version only in development environments, as errors shown to
; application users can inadvertently leak otherwise secure information.

; This is the php.ini-production INI file.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Quick Reference ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; The following are all the settings which are different in either the production
; or development versions of the INIs with respect to PHP's default behavior.
; Please see the actual settings later in the document for more details as to why
; we recommend these changes in PHP's behavior.

; This directive determines whether or not PHP will recognize code between
; <? and ?> tags as PHP source which should be processed as such. It is
; generally recommended that <?php and ?> should be used and that this feature
; should be disabled, as enabling it may result in issues when generating XML
; documents, however this remains supported for backward compatibility reasons.
; Note that this directive does not control the <?= shorthand tag, which can be
; used regardless of this directive.

; https://php.net/short-open-tag

; https://php.net/precision

; Output buffering is a mechanism for controlling how much output data
; (excluding headers and cookies) PHP should keep internally before pushing that
; data to the client. If your application's output exceeds this setting, PHP
; will send that data in chunks of roughly the size you specify.
; Turning on this setting and managing its maximum buffer size can yield some
; interesting side-effects depending on your application and web server.
; You may be able to send headers and cookies after you've already sent output
; through print or echo. You also may see performance benefits if your server is
; emitting less packets due to buffered output versus PHP streaming the output
; as it gets it. On production servers, 4096 bytes is a good setting for performance
; reasons.
; Note: Output buffering can also be controlled via Output Buffering Control
;   functions.
; Possible Values:
;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
;   Off = Disabled
;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
; Default Value: Off
; Development Value: 4096
; Production Value: 4096
; https://php.net/output-buffering
output_buffering = 4096

; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
;   directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
;   Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script
;   is doing.
; Note: You cannot use both "mb_output_handler" with "ob_iconv_handler"
;   and you cannot use both "ob_gzhandler" and "zlib.output_compression".
; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!
;   Instead you must use zlib.output_handler.
; https://php.net/output-handler
;output_handler =

; URL rewriter function rewrites URL on the fly by using
; output buffer. You can set target tags by this configuration.
; "form" tag is special tag. It will add hidden input tag to pass values.
; Refer to session.trans_sid_tags for usage.
; Default Value: "form="
; Development Value: "form="
; Production Value: "form="
;url_rewriter.tags

; URL rewriter will not rewrite absolute URL nor form by default. To enable
; absolute URL rewrite, allowed hosts must be defined at RUNTIME.
; Refer to session.trans_sid_hosts for more details.
; Default Value: ""
; Development Value: ""
; Production Value: ""
;url_rewriter.hosts

; Transparent output compression using the zlib library
; Valid values for this option are 'off', 'on', or a specific buffer size
; to be used for compression (default is 4KB)
; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP
;   outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
;   compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
;   performance, enable output_buffe
... (output truncated at 10000 characters)

; interesting side-effects depending on your application and web server.
; You may be able to send headers and cookies after you've already sent output
; through print or echo. You also may see performance benefits if your server is
; emitting less packets due to buffered output versus PHP streaming the output
; as it gets it. On production servers, 4096 bytes is a good setting for performance
; reasons.
; Note: Output buffering can also be controlled via Output Buffering Control
;   functions.
; Possible Values:
;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)
;   Off = Disabled
;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.
; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
; Default Value: Off
; Development Value: 4096
; Production Value: 4096
; https://php.net/output-buffering
output_buffering = 4096

; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
;   directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
;   Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script
;   is doing.
; Note: You cannot use both "mb_output_handler" with "ob_iconv_handler"
;   and you cannot use both "ob_gzhandler" and "zlib.output_compression".
; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!
;   Instead you must use zlib.output_handler.
; https://php.net/output-handler
;output_handler =

; URL rewriter function rewrites URL on the fly by using
; output buffer. You can set target tags by this configuration.
; "form" tag is special tag. It will add hidden input tag to pass values.
; Refer to session.trans_sid_tags for usage.
; Default Value: "form="
; Development Value: "form="
; Production Value: "form="
;url_rewriter.tags

; URL rewriter will not rewrite absolute URL nor form by default. To enable
; absolute URL rewrite, allowed hosts must be defined at RUNTIME.
; Refer to session.trans_sid_hosts for more details.
; Default Value: ""
; Development Value: ""
; Production Value: ""
;url_rewriter.hosts

; Transparent output compression using the zlib library
; Valid values for this option are 'off', 'on', or a specific buffer size
; to be used for compression (default is 4KB)
; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP
;   outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
;   compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
;   performance, enable output_buffe
... (output truncated at 10000 characters)

DESCRIPTION: cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output

USAGE: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
COMMAND INPUT:
cat /etc/security/limits.conf

COMMAND OUTPUT:
# /etc/security/limits.conf
#
#This file sets the resource limits for the users logged in via PAM.
#It does not affect resource limits of the system services.
#
#Also note that configuration files in /etc/security/limits.d directory,
#which are read in alphabetical order, override the settings in this
#file in case the domain is the same or more specific.
#That means, for example, that setting a limit for wildcard domain here
#can be overridden with a wildcard setting in a config file in the
#subdirectory, but a user specific setting here can be overridden only
#with a user specific setting in the subdirectory.
#
#Each line describes a limit for a user in the form:
#
#<domain>        <type>  <item>  <value>
#
#Where:
#<domain> can be:
#        - a user name
#        - a group name, with @group syntax
#        - the wildcard *, for default entry
#        - the wildcard %, can be also used with %group syntax,
#                 for maxlogin limit
#        - NOTE: group and wildcard limits are not applied to root.
#          To apply a limit to the root user, <domain> must be
#          the literal username root.
#
#<type> can have the two values:
#        - "soft" for enforcing the soft limits
#        - "hard" for enforcing hard limits
#
#<item> can be one of the following:
#        - core - limits the core file size (KB)
#        - data - max data size (KB)
#        - fsize - maximum filesize (KB)
#        - memlock - max locked-in-memory address space (KB)
#        - nofile - max number of open file descriptors
#        - rss - max resident set size (KB)
#        - stack - max stack size (KB)
#        - cpu - max CPU time (MIN)
#        - nproc - max number of processes
#        - as - address space limit (KB)
#        - maxlogins - max number of logins for this user
#        - maxsyslogins - max number of logins on the system
#        - priority - the priority to run user process with
#        - locks - max number of file locks the user can hold
#        - sigpending - max number of pending signals
#        - msgqueue - max memory used by POSIX message queues (bytes)
#        - nice - max nice priority allowed to raise to values: [-20, 19]
#        - rtprio - max realtime priority
#        - chroot - change root to directory (Debian-specific)
#
#<domain>      <type>  <item>         <value>
#

#*               soft    core            0

COMMAND: dpkg

DESCRIPTION: dpkg - package manager for Debian

USAGE: dpkg [option...] action

OPTIONS:
All options can be specified both on the command line and in the dpkg
       configuration file /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg or fragment files (with names
       matching this shell pattern '[0-9a-zA-Z_-]*') on the configuration
       directory /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/. Each line in the configuration file is
       either an option (exactly the same as the command line option but
       without leading hyphens) or a comment (if it starts with a '#').

       --abort-after=number
           Change after how many errors dpkg will abort. The default is 50.

       -B, --auto-deconfigure
           When a package is removed, there is a possibility that another
           installed package depended on the removed package. Specifying this
           option will cause automatic deconfiguration of the package which
           depended on the removed package.

       -Doctal, --debug=octal
           Switch debugging on. octal is formed by bitwise-ORing desired
           values together from the list below (note that these values may
           change in future releases). -Dh or --debug=help display these
           debugging values.

               Number   Description
                    1   Generally helpful progress information
                    2   Invocation and status of maintainer scripts
                   10   Output for each file processed
                  100   Lots of output for each file processed
                   20   Output for each configuration file
                  200   Lots of output for each configuration file
                   40   Dependencies and conflicts
                  400   Lots of dependencies/conflicts output
                10000   Trigger activation and processing
                20000   Lots of output regarding triggers
                40000   Silly amounts of output regarding triggers
                 1000   Lots of drivel about for example the dpkg/info dir
                 2000   Insane amounts of drivel

       --force-things
       --no-force-things, --refuse-things
           Force or refuse (no-force and refuse mean the same thing) to do
           some things. things is a comma separated list of things specified
           below. --force-help displays a message describing them.  Things
           marked with (*) are forced by default.

           Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by experts
           only. Using them without fully understanding their effects may
           break your whole system.

           all: Turns on (or off) all force options.

           downgrade(*): Install a package, even if newer version of it is
           already installed.

           Warning: At present dpkg does not do any dependency checking on
           downgrades and therefore will not warn you if the downgrade breaks
           the dependency of some other package. This can have serious side
           effects, downgrading essential system components can even make your
           whole system unusable. Use with care.

           configure-any: Configure also any unpacked but unconfigured
           packages on which the current package depends.

           hold: Allow automatic installs, upgrades or removals of packages
           even when marked to be on "hold".  Note: When these actions are
           requested explicitly, the "hold" package selection state always
           gets ignored.

           remove-reinstreq: Remove a package, even if it's broken and marked
           to require reinstallation. This may, for example, cause parts of
           the package to remain on the system, which will then be forgotten
           by dpkg.

           remove-protected: Remove, even if the package is considered
           protected (since dpkg 1.20.1).  Protected packages contain mostly
           important system boot infrastructure or are used for custom system-
           local meta-packages.  Removing them might cause the whole system to
           be unable to boot or lose required functionality to operate, so use
           with caution.

           remove-essential: Remove, even if the package is considered
           essential.  Essential packages contain mostly very basic Unix
           commands, required for the packaging system, for the operation of
           the system in general or during boot (although the latter should be
           converted to protected packages instead).  Removing them might
           cause the whole system to stop working, so use with caution.

           depends: Turn all dependency problems into warnings.  This affects
           the Pre-Depends and Depends fields.

           depends-version: Don't care about versions when checking
           dependencies.  This affects the Pre-Depends and Depends fields.

           breaks: Install, even if this would break another package (since
           dpkg 1.14.6).  This affects the Breaks field.

           conflicts: Install, even if it conflicts with another package. This
           is dangerous, for it will usually cause overwriting of some files.
           This affects the Conflicts field.

           confmiss: Always install the missing conffile without prompting.
           This is dangerous, since it means not preserving a change
           (removing) made to the file.

           confnew: If a conffile has been modified and the version in the
           package did change, always install the new version without
           prompting, unless the --force-confdef is also specified, in which
           case the default action is preferred.

           confold: If a conffile has been modified and the version in the
           package did change, always keep the old version without prompting,
           unless the --force-confdef is also specified, in which case the
           default action is preferred.

           confdef: If a conffile has been modified and the version in the
           package did change, always choose the default action without
           prompting. If there is no default action it will stop to ask the
           user unless --force-confnew or --force-confold is also been given,
           in which case it will use that to decide the final action.

           confask: If a conffile has been modified always offer to replace it
           with the version in the package, even if the version in the package
           did not change (since dpkg 1.15.8).  If any of --force-confnew,
           --force-confold, or --force-confdef is also given, it will be used
           to decide the final action.

           overwrite: Overwrite one package's file with another's file.

           overwrite-dir: Overwrite one package's directory with another's
           file.

           overwrite-diverted: Overwrite a diverted file with an undiverted
           version.

           statoverride-add: Overwrite an existing stat override when adding
           it (since dpkg 1.19.5).

           statoverride-remove: Ignore a missing stat override when removing
           it (since dpkg 1.19.5).

           security-mac(*): Use platform-specific Mandatory Access Controls
           (MAC) based security when installing files into the filesystem
           (since dpkg 1.19.5).  On Linux systems the implementation uses
           SELinux.

           unsafe-io: Do not perform safe I/O operations when unpacking (since
           dpkg 1.15.8.6).  Currently this implies not performing file system
           syncs before file renames, which is known to cause substantial
           performance degradation on some file systems, unfortunately the
           ones that require the safe I/O on the first place due to their
           unreliable behaviour causing zero-length files on abrupt system
           crashes.

           Note: For ext4, the main offender, consider using instead the mount
           option nodelalloc, which will fix both the performance degradation
           and the data safety issues, the latter by making the file system
           not produce zero-length files on abrupt system crashes with any
           software not doing syncs before atomic renames.

           Warning: Using this option might improve performance at the cost of
           losing data, use with care.

           script-chrootless: Run maintainer scripts without chroot(2)ing into
           instdir even if the package does not support this mode of operation
           (since dpkg 1.18.5).

           Warning: This can destroy your host system, use with extreme care.

           architecture: Process even packages with wrong or no architecture.

           bad-version: Process even packages with wrong versions (since dpkg
           1.16.1).

           bad-path: PATH is missing important programs, so problems are
           likely.

           not-root: Try to (de)install things even when not root.

           bad-verify: Install a package even if it fails authenticity check.

       --ignore-depends=package,...
           Ignore dependency-checking for specified packages (actually,
           checking is performed, but only warnings about conflicts are given,
           nothing else).  This affects the Pre-Depends, Depends and Breaks
           fields.

       --no-act, --dry-run, --simulate
           Do everything which is supposed to be done, but don't write any
           changes. This is used to see what would happen with the specified
           action, without actually modifying anything.

           Be sure to give --no-act before the action-parameter, or you might
           end up with undesirable results. (e.g. dpkg --purge foo --no-act
           will first purge package "foo" and then try to purge package
           "--no-act", even though you probably expected it to actually do
           nothing).

       -R, --recursive
           Recursively handle all regular files matching pattern *.deb found
           at specified directories and all of its subdirectories. This can be
           used with -i, -A, --install, --unpack and --record-avail actions.

       -G  Don't install a package if a newer version of the same package is
           already installed. This is an alias of --refuse-downgrade.

       --admindir=dir
           Set the administrative directory to directory.  This directory
           contains many files that give information about status of installed
           or uninstalled packages, etc.  Defaults to <</var/lib/dpkg>> if
           DPKG_ADMINDIR has not been set.

       --instdir=dir
           Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory where
           packages are to be installed. instdir is also the directory passed
           to chroot(2) before running package's installation scripts, which
           means that the scripts see instdir as a root directory.  Defaults
           to <</>>.

       --root=dir
           Set the root directory to directory, which sets the installation
           directory to <<dir>> and the administrative directory to
           <<dir/var/lib/dpkg>>.

       -O, --selected-only
           Only process the packages that are selected for installation. The
           actual marking is done with dselect or by dpkg, when it handles
           packages. For example, when a package is removed, it will be marked
           selected for deinstallation.

       -E, --skip-same-version
           Don't install the package if the same version and architecture of
           the package is already installed.

           Since dpkg 1.21.10, the architecture is also taken into account,
           which makes it possible to cross-grade packages or install
           additional co-installable instances with the same version, but
           different architecture.

       --pre-invoke=command
       --post-invoke=command
           Set an invoke hook command to be run via "sh -c" before or after
           the dpkg run for the unpack, configure, install, triggers-only,
           remove, purge, add-architecture and remove-architecture dpkg
           actions (since dpkg 1.15.4; add-architecture and remove-
           architecture actions since dpkg 1.17.19). This option can be
           specified multiple times. The order the options are specified is
           preserved, with the ones from the configuration files taking
           precedence.  The environment variable DPKG_HOOK_ACTION is set for
           the hooks to the current dpkg action.

           Note: Front-ends might call dpkg several times per invocation,
           which might run the hooks more times than expected.

       --path-exclude=glob-pattern
       --path-include=glob-pattern
           Set glob-pattern as a path filter, either by excluding or re-
           including previously excluded paths matching the specified patterns
           during install (since dpkg 1.15.8).

           Warning: Take into account that depending on the excluded paths you
           might completely break your system, use with caution.

           The glob patterns use the same wildcards used in the shell, were
           '*' matches any sequence of characters, including the empty string
           and also '/'.  For example, <</usr/*/READ*>> matches
           <</usr/share/doc/package/README>>.  As usual, '?' matches any
           single character (again, including '/').  And '[' starts a
           character class, which can contain a list of characters, ranges and
           complementations. See glob(7) for detailed information about
           globbing.  Note: The current implementation might re-include more
           directories and symlinks than needed, in particular when there is a
           more specific re-inclusion, to be on the safe side and avoid
           possible unpack failures; future work might fix this.

           This can be used to remove all paths except some particular ones; a
           typical case is:

            --path-exclude=/usr/share/doc/*
            --path-include=/usr/share/doc/*/copyright

           to remove all documentation files except the copyright files.

           These two options can be specified multiple times, and interleaved
           with each other. Both are processed in the given order, with the
           last rule that matches a file name making the decision.

           The filters are applied when unpacking the binary packages, and as
           such only have knowledge of the type of object currently being
           filtered (e.g. a normal file or a directory) and have not
           visibility of what objects will come next.  Because these filters
           have side effects (in contrast to find(1) filters), excluding an
           exact pathname that happens to be a directory object like
           /usr/share/doc will not have the desired result, and only that
           pathname will be excluded (which could be automatically reincluded
           if the code sees the need).  Any subsequent files contained within
           that directory will fail to unpack.

           Hint: make sure the globs are not expanded by your shell.

       --verify-format format-name
           Sets the output format for the --verify command (since dpkg
           1.17.2).

           The only currently supported output format is rpm, which consists
           of a line for every path that failed any check.  These lines have
           the following format:

            missing   [c] pathname [(error-message)]
            ??5?????? [c] pathname

           The first 9 characters are used to report the checks result, either
           a literal missing when the file is not present or its metadata
           cannot be fetched, or one of the following special characters that
           report the result for each check:

           '?' Implies the check could not be done (lack of support, file
               permissions, etc).

           '.' Implies the check passed.

           'A-Za-z0-9'
               Implies a specific check failed.  The following positions and
               alphanumeric characters are currently supported:

               1 '?'
                   These checks are currently not supported, will always be
                   '?'.

               2 'M'
                   The file mode check failed (since dpkg 1.21.0).  Because
                   pathname metadata is currently not tracked, this check can
                   only be partially emulated via a very simple heuristic for
                   pathnames that have a known digest, which implies they
                   should be regular files, where the check will fail if the
                   pathname is not a regular file on the filesystem.  This
                   check will currently never succeed as it does not have
                   enough information available.

               3 '5'
                   The digest check failed, which means the file contents have
                   changed.

               4-9 '?'
                   These checks are currently not supported, will always be
                   '?'.

           The line is followed by a space and an attribute character.  The
           following attribute character is supported:

           'c' The pathname is a conffile.

           Finally followed by another space and the pathname.

           In case the entry was of the missing type, and the file was not
           actually present on the filesystem, then the line is followed by a
           space and the error message enclosed within parenthesis.

       --status-fd n
           Send machine-readable package status and progress information to
           file descriptor n. This option can be specified multiple times. The
           information is generally one record per line, in one of the
           following forms:

           status: package: status
               Package status changed; status is as in the status file.

           status: package : error : extended-error-message
               An error occurred. Any possible newlines in extended-error-
               message will be converted to spaces before output.

           status: file : conffile-prompt : 'real-old' 'real-new' useredited
           distedited
               User is being asked a conffile question.

           processing: stage: package
               Sent just before a processing stage starts. stage is one of
               upgrade, install (both sent before unpacking), configure,
               trigproc, disappear, remove, purge.

       --status-logger=command
           Send machine-readable package status and progress information to
           the shell command's standard input, to be run via "sh -c" (since
           dpkg 1.16.0).  This option can be specified multiple times.  The
           output format used is the same as in --status-fd.

       --log=filename
           Log status change updates and actions to filename, instead of the
           default /var/log/dpkg.log. If this option is given multiple times,
           the last filename is used. Log messages are of the form:

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS startup type command
               For each dpkg invocation where type is archives (with a command
               of unpack or install) or packages (with a command of configure,
               triggers-only, remove or purge).

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS status state pkg installed-version
               For status change updates.

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS action pkg installed-version available-version
               For actions where action is one of install, upgrade, configure,
               trigproc, disappear, remove or purge.

           YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS conffile filename decision
               For conffile changes where decision is either install or keep.

       --robot
           Use a machine-readable output format. This provides an interface
           for programs that need to parse the output of some of the commands
           that do not otherwise emit a machine-readable output format. No
           localization will be used, and the output will be modified to make
           it easier to parse.

           The only currently supported command is --version.

       --no-pager
           Disables the use of any pager when showing information (since dpkg
           1.19.2).

       --no-debsig
           Do not try to verify package signatures.

       --no-triggers
           Do not run any triggers in this run (since dpkg 1.14.17), but
           activations will still be recorded.  If used with --configure
           package or --triggers-only package then the named package postinst
           will still be run even if only a triggers run is needed. Use of
           this option may leave packages in the improper triggers-awaited and
           triggers-pending states. This can be fixed later by running: dpkg
           --configure --pending.

       --triggers
           Cancels a previous --no-triggers (since dpkg 1.14.17).

OPTIONS:
These options can be used in all the different modes.

       -?, --help
              Print a longer usage message than normal.

       --version
              Print  a  single line containing the version number of rpm being
              used.

       --quiet
              Print as little as possible - normally only error messages  will
              be displayed.

       -v, --verbose
              Print  verbose  information - normally routine progress messages
              will be displayed.

       -vv    Print lots of ugly debugging information.

       --rcfile FILELIST
              Replace the list of configuration files to be read.  Each of the
              files  in  the  colon separated FILELIST is read sequentially by
              rpm for configuration information.  Only the first file  in  the
              list  must  exist,  and  tildes will be expanded to the value of
              $HOME.     The    default    FILELIST    is    /usr/lib/rpm/rpm-
              rc:/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.

       --load FILE
              Load an individual macro file.

       --macros FILELIST
              Replace the list of macro files to be loaded.  Each of the files
              in the colon separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm  for
              macro  definitions.  Only the first file in the list must exist,
              and tildes will be expanded to the value of $HOME.  The  default
              FILELIST                                                      is
              /usr/lib/rpm/macros:/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/macros.*:/usr/lib/rpm/plat-
              form/%{_target}/macros:/usr/lib/rpm/fileattrs/*.at-
              tr:/usr/lib/rpm/red-
              hat/macros:/etc/rpm/macros.*:/etc/rpm/macros:/etc/rpm/%{_tar-
              get}/macros:~/.rpmmacros

       --pipe CMD
              Pipes the output of rpm to the command CMD.

       --dbpath DIRECTORY
              Use the database in  DIRECTORY  rather  than  the  default  path
              /var/lib/rpm

       --root DIRECTORY
              Use the file system tree rooted at DIRECTORY for all operations.
              Note that this means the database within DIRECTORY will be  used
              for  dependency  checks  and any scriptlet(s) (e.g. %post if in-
              stalling, or %prep if building, a package) will be run  after  a
              chroot(2) to DIRECTORY.

              Note  that rpm assumes the environment inside the root is set up
              by the caller, such as any mounts needed for the  operation  in-
              side the root directory.

       -D, --define='MACRO EXPR'
              Defines MACRO with value EXPR.

       --undefine='MACRO'
              Undefines MACRO.

       -E, --eval='EXPR'
              Prints macro expansion of EXPR.

       More  - less often needed - options can be found on the rpm-misc(8) man
       page.

   INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS
       In these options, PACKAGE_FILE can be either rpm binary file  or  ASCII
       package  manifest (see PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS), and may be specified
       as an ftp or http URL, in which case the package will be downloaded be-
       fore  being  installed.   See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for information on rpm's
       ftp and http client support.

       The general form of an rpm install command is

       rpm {-i|--install} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

       This installs a new package.

       The general form of an rpm upgrade command is

       rpm {-U|--upgrade} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

       This upgrades or installs the package currently installed  to  a  newer
       version.   This  is the same as install, except all other version(s) of
       the package are removed after the new package is installed.

       rpm {-F|--freshen} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

       This will upgrade packages, but only ones for which an earlier  version
       is installed.

       The general form of an rpm reinstall command is

       rpm {--reinstall} [install-options] PACKAGE_FILE ...

       This reinstalls a previously installed package.

       --allfiles
              Installs or upgrades all the missingok files in the package, re-
              gardless if they exist.

       --badreloc
              Used with --relocate, permit relocations on all file paths,  not
              just  those  OLDPATH's included in the binary package relocation
              hint(s).

       --excludepath OLDPATH
              Don't install files whose name begins with OLDPATH.

       --excludeartifacts
              Don't install any files which are marked as artifacts,  such  as
              build-id links.

       --excludedocs
              Don't install any files which are marked as documentation (which
              includes man pages and texinfo documents).

       --force
              Same as using --replacepkgs, --replacefiles, and --oldpackage.

       -h, --hash
              Print 50 hash marks as the package  archive  is  unpacked.   Use
              with -v|--verbose for a nicer display.

       --ignoresize
              Don't  check mount file systems for sufficient disk space before
              installing this package.

       --ignorearch
              Allow installation or upgrading even if the architectures of the
              binary package and host don't match.

       --ignoreos
              Allow installation or upgrading even if the operating systems of
              the binary package and host don't match.

       --includedocs
              Install documentation files.  This is the default behavior.

       --justdb
              Update only the database, not the filesystem.

       --nodb Update only the filesystem, not the database.

       --nodigest
              Don't verify package or header digests when reading.

       --nomanifest
              Don't process non-package files as manifests.

       --nosignature
              Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.

       --nodeps
              Don't do a dependency check before  installing  or  upgrading  a
              package.

       --nocaps
              Don't set file capabilities.

       --noorder
              Don't reorder the packages for an install.  The list of packages
              would normally be reordered to satisfy dependencies.

       --noverify
              Don't perform verify package files prior to installation.

       --noplugins
              Do not load and execute plugins.

       --noscripts, --nopre, --nopost,  --nopreun,  --nopostun,  --nopretrans,
       --noposttrans
              Don't  execute  the scriptlet of the same name.  The --noscripts
              option is equivalent to

       --nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun --nopretrans --noposttrans

       and turns off the execution of the corresponding %pre,  %post,  %preun,
       %postun %pretrans, and %posttrans scriptlet(s).

       --notriggers, --notriggerin, --notriggerun, --notriggerprein, --notrig-
       gerpostun
              Don't execute any trigger scriptlet  of  the  named  type.   The
              --notriggers option is equivalent to

       --notriggerprein --notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun

       and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerprein, %triggerin,
       %triggerun, and %triggerpostun scriptlet(s).

       --oldpackage
              Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package with an older one.

       --percent
              Print percentages as files are unpacked  from  the  package  ar-
              chive.   This  is  intended  to  make rpm easy to run from other
              tools.

       --prefix NEWPATH
              For relocatable binary packages, translate all file  paths  that
              start  with  the  installation  prefix in the package relocation
              hint(s) to NEWPATH.

       --relocate OLDPATH=NEWPATH
              For relocatable binary packages, translate all file  paths  that
              start with OLDPATH in the package relocation hint(s) to NEWPATH.
              This option can be used repeatedly if several OLDPATH's  in  the
              package are to be relocated.

       --replacefiles
              Install  the packages even if they replace files from other, al-
              ready installed, packages.

       --replacepkgs
              Install the packages even if some of them are already  installed
              on this system.

       --test Do  not  install the package, simply check for and report poten-
              tial conflicts.

   ERASE OPTIONS
       The general form of an rpm erase command is

       rpm {-e|--erase}  [--allmatches]  [--justdb]  [--nodeps]  [--noscripts]
       [--notriggers] [--test] PACKAGE_NAME ...

       The following options may also be used:

       --allmatches
              Remove  all  versions  of  the package which match PACKAGE_NAME.
              Normally an error is issued  if  PACKAGE_NAME  matches  multiple
              packages.

       --justdb
              Update only the database, not the filesystem.

       --nodeps
              Don't check dependencies before uninstalling the packages.

       --noscripts, --nopreun, --nopostun
              Don't  execute  the scriptlet of the same name.  The --noscripts
              option during package erase is equivalent to

       --nopreun --nopostun

       and turns off the execution of the corresponding  %preun,  and  %postun
       scriptlet(s).

       --notriggers, --notriggerun, --notriggerpostun
              Don't  execute  any  trigger  scriptlet  of the named type.  The
              --notriggers option is equivalent to

       --notriggerun --notriggerpostun

       and turns off execution of the corresponding %triggerun, and  %trigger-
       postun scriptlet(s).

       --test Don't  really  uninstall  anything, just go through the motions.
              Useful in conjunction with the -vv option for debugging.

   QUERY OPTIONS
       The general form of an rpm query command is

       rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]

       You may specify the format that package information should  be  printed
       in.  To do this, you use the

       --qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT

       option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string.  Query formats are mod-
       ified versions of the standard printf(3)  formatting.   The  format  is
       made  up  of static strings (which may include standard C character es-
       capes for newlines, tabs, and other special characters  (not  including
       \0))  and  printf(3) type formatters.  As rpm already knows the type to
       print, the type specifier must be omitted however, and replaced by  the
       name  of  the header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters.  Tag
       names are case insensitive, and the leading RPMTAG_ portion of the  tag
       name may be omitted as well.

       Alternate  output  formats  may  be requested by following the tag with
       :typetag.  Currently, the following types are supported:

       :armor Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.

       :arraysize
              Display number of elements in array tags.

       :base64
              Encode binary data using base64.

       :date  Use strftime(3) "%c" format.

       :day   Use strftime(3) "%a %b %d %Y" format.

       :depflags
              Format dependency comparison operator.

       :deptype
              Format dependency type.

       :expand
              Perform macro expansion.

       :fflags
              Format file flags.

       :fstate
              Format file state.

       :fstatus
              Format file verify status.

       :hex   Format in hexadecimal.

       :octal Format in octal.

       :humaniec
              Human readable number (in IEC 80000).  The suffix K = 1024, M  =
              1048576, ...

       :humansi
              Human  readable  number  (in  SI).   The  suffix  K  = 1000, M =
              1000000, ...

       :perms Format file permissions.

       :pgpsig
              Display signature fingerprint and time.

       :shescape
              Escape single quotes for use in a script.

       :string
              Display string format.  (default)

       :tagname
              Display tag name.

       :tagnum
              Display tag number.

       :triggertype
              Display trigger suffix.

       :vflags
              File verification flags.

       :xml   Wrap data in simple xml markup.

       For example, to print only the names of the packages queried, you could
       use  %{NAME} as the format string.  To print the packages name and dis-
       tribution information in two columns, you could use %-30{NAME}%{DISTRI-
       BUTION}.   rpm will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when
       it is invoked with the --querytags argument.

       There are three subsets of options  for  querying:  package  selection,
       file selection and information selection.

   PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS:
       PACKAGE_NAME
              Query  installed  package  named  PACKAGE_NAME.   To specify the
              package more precisely the package name may be followed  by  the
              version  or  version  and release both separated by a dash or an
              architecture name separated by a dot.  See the output of rpm -qa
              or rpm -qp PACKAGE_FILE as an example.

       -a, --all [SELECTOR]
              Query all installed packages.

       An optional SELECTOR in the form of tag=pattern can be provided to nar-
       row the selection, for example name="b*" to query packages  whose  name
       starts with "b".

       --dupes
              List duplicated packages.

       -f, --file FILE
              Query package owning installed FILE.

       --filecaps
              List file names with POSIX1.e capabilities.

       --fileclass
              List file names with their classes (libmagic classification).

       --filecolor
              List  file names with their colors (0 for noarch, 1 for 32bit, 2
              for 64 bit).

       --fileprovide
              List file names with their provides.

       --filerequire
              List file names with their requires.

       -g, --group GROUP
              Query packages with the group of GROUP.

       --hdrid SHA1
              Query package that contains a given header identifier,  i.e. the
              SHA1 digest of the immutable header region.

       -p, --package PACKAGE_FILE
              Query  an  (uninstalled) package PACKAGE_FILE.  The PACKAGE_FILE
              may be specified as an ftp or http style URL, in which case  the
              package header will be downloaded and queried.  See FTP/HTTP OP-
              TIONS for information on rpm's ftp and http client support.  The
              PACKAGE_FILE  argument(s),  if not a binary package, will be in-
              terpreted as an ASCII package manifest unless  --nomanifest  op-
              tion  is  used.   In manifests, comments are permitted, starting
              with a '#', and each line of a package manifest file may include
              white  space  separated  glob expressions, including URL's, that
              will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place  of  the
              package  manifest  as  additional  PACKAGE_FILE arguments to the
              query.

       --path PATH
              Query package(s) owning PATH, whether the file is  installed  or
              not.   Multiple  packages  may  own a PATH, but the file is only
              owned by the package installed last.

       --pkgid MD5
              Query package that contains a given package identifier, i.e. the
              MD5 digest of the combined header and payload contents.

       --querybynumber HDRNUM
              Query  the HDRNUMth database entry directly; this is useful only
              for debugging.

       --specfile SPECFILE
              Parse and query SPECFILE as if it were a package.  Although  not
              all the information (e.g. file lists) is available, this type of
              query permits rpm to be used to extract  information  from  spec
              files without having to write a specfile parser.

       --tid TID
              Query  package(s)  that have a given TID transaction identifier.
              A unix time stamp is currently used as a transaction identifier.
              All  package(s)  installed or erased within a single transaction
              have a common identifier.

       --triggeredby PACKAGE_NAME
              Query packages that are triggered by package(s) PACKAGE_NAME.

       --whatobsoletes CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that obsolete CAPABILITY for proper function-
              ing.

       --whatprovides CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that provide the CAPABILITY capability.

       --whatrequires CAPABILITY
              Query  all packages that require CAPABILITY for proper function-
              ing.

       --whatconflicts CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that conflict with CAPABILITY.

       --whatrecommends CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that recommend CAPABILITY.

       --whatsuggests CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that suggest CAPABILITY.

       --whatsupplements CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that supplement CAPABILITY.

       --whatenhances CAPABILITY
              Query all packages that enhance CAPABILITY.

       -i, --info
              Display  package  information,  including name, version, and de-
              scription.  This uses the --queryformat if one was specified.

       --last Orders the package listing by install time such that the  latest
              packages are at the top.

       -l, --list

              state of each file is one of normal, not installed, or replaced.

       --triggers, --triggerscripts
              Display  the trigger scripts, if any, which are contained in the
              package.  --xml Format package headers as XML.

   FILE SELECTION OPTIONS:
       -A, --artifactfiles
              Only include artifact files (implies -l).

       -c, --configfiles

       --noconfig
              Exclude config files.

       --noghost
              Exclude ghost files.

   VERIFY OPTIONS
       The general form of an rpm verify command is

       rpm {-V|--verify} [select-options] [verify-options]

       Verifying a package compares information about the installed  files  in
       the  package  with  information  about the files taken from the package
       metadata stored in the rpm database.   Among  other  things,  verifying
       compares  the  size, digest, permissions, type, owner and group of each
       file.  Any discrepancies are displayed.  Files that were not  installed
       from  the package, for example, documentation files excluded on instal-
       lation using the "--excludedocs" option, will be silently ignored.

       The package and file selection options are  the  same  as  for  package
       querying  (including  package  manifest files as arguments).  Other op-
       tions unique to verify mode are:

       --nodeps
              Don't verify dependencies of packages.

       --nodigest
              Don't verify package or header digests when reading.

       --nofiles
              Don't verify any attributes of package files.

       --noscripts
              Don't execute the %verifyscript scriptlet (if any).

       --nosignature
              Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.

       --nolinkto

       --nofiledigest (formerly --nomd5)

       --nosize

       --nouser

       --nogroup

       --nomtime

       --nomode

       --nordev
              Don't verify the corresponding file attribute.

       --nocaps
              Don't verify file capabilities.

       The format of the output is a string of 9 characters, a possible attri-
       bute marker:

              c %config configuration file.
              d %doc documentation file.
              g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in the package payload).
              l %license license file.
              r %readme readme file.

       from  the  package  header,  followed  by the file name.  Each of the 9
       characters denotes the result of a comparison of  attribute(s)  of  the
       file  to  the  value of those attribute(s) recorded in the database.  A
       single "." (period) means the test passed, while a single "?" (question
       mark)  indicates the test could not be performed (e.g. file permissions
       prevent reading).  Otherwise, the (mnemonically  emBoldened)  character
       denotes failure of the corresponding --verify test:

              S file Size differs
              M Mode differs (includes permissions and file type)
              5 digest (formerly MD5 sum) differs
              D Device major/minor number mismatch
              L readLink(2) path mismatch
              U User ownership differs
              G Group ownership differs
              T mTime differs
              P caPabilities differ

   MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS
       rpm --showrc
              shows  the  values  rpm will use for all of the options are cur-
              rently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).

       rpm --setperms | --setugids | --setcaps PACKAGE_NAME
              obsolete aliases for --restore

       rpm --restore [select-options]
              The option restores file  metadata  such  as  timestamp,  owner,
              group, permissions and capabilities of files in packages.

   FTP/HTTP OPTIONS
       rpm  can  act  as  an  FTP  and/or  HTTP client so that packages can be
       queried or installed from the internet.  Package files for install, up-
       grade,  and  query  operations may be specified as an ftp or http style
       URL:

       http://HOST[:PORT]/path/to/package.rpm

       ftp://[USER:PASSWORD]@HOST[:PORT]/path/to/package.rpm

       If both the user and password are omitted, anonymous ftp is used.

       rpm allows the following options to be used with ftp URLs:

       rpm allows the following options to be used with
              http and ftp URLs:

       --httpproxy HOST
              The host HOST will be used as a proxy server for  all  http  and
              ftp transfers.  This option may also be specified by configuring
              the macro %_httpproxy.

       --httpport PORT
              The TCP PORT number to use for the http connection on the  proxy
              http  server  instead of the default port.  This option may also
              be specified by configuring the macro %_httpport.

COMMAND: bash

DESCRIPTION: bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

USAGE: bash [options] [command_string | file]

OPTIONS:
All of the single-character shell options documented in the description
       of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as  options  when
       the  shell  is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following op-
       tions when it is invoked:

       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from  the
                 first non-option argument command_string.  If there are argu-
                 ments after the command_string, the  first  argument  is  as-
                 signed  to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the
                 positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of
                 the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.
       -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
                 INVOCATION below).
       -r        If the -r option is present,  the  shell  becomes  restricted
                 (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).
       -s        If  the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after
                 option processing, then commands are read from  the  standard
                 input.   This  option  allows the positional parameters to be
                 set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading  input
                 through a pipe.
       -v        Print shell input lines as they are read.
       -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
       -D        A  list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed
                 on the standard output.  These are the strings that are  sub-
                 ject to language translation when the current locale is not C
                 or POSIX.  This implies the -n option; no  commands  will  be
                 executed.
       [-+]O [shopt_option]
                 shopt_option  is  one  of  the  shell options accepted by the
                 shopt  builtin  (see  SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below).    If
                 shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O
                 unsets it.  If shopt_option is not supplied,  the  names  and
                 values  of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on
                 the standard output.  If the invocation  option  is  +O,  the
                 output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
       --        A  --  signals the end of options and disables further option
                 processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as  file-
                 names and arguments.  An argument of - is equivalent to --.

       Bash  also  interprets  a number of multi-character options.  These op-
       tions must appear on the command line before the  single-character  op-
       tions to be recognized.

       --debugger
              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell
              starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see  the  description
              of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).
       --dump-po-strings
              Equivalent  to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (por-
              table object) file format.
       --dump-strings
              Equivalent to -D.
       --help Display a usage message on standard  output  and  exit  success-
              fully.
       --init-file file
       --rcfile file
              Execute  commands  from file instead of the system wide initial-
              ization file /etc/bash.bashrc and the standard personal initial-
              ization  file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive (see INVOCA-
              TION below).

       --login
              Equivalent to -l.

       --noediting
              Do not use the GNU readline library to read command  lines  when
              the shell is interactive.

       --noprofile
              Do  not read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or
              any  of  the  personal  initialization  files   ~/.bash_profile,
              ~/.bash_login,  or  ~/.profile.   By  default,  bash reads these
              files when it is invoked as a login shell  (see  INVOCATION  be-
              low).

       --norc Do  not  read  and  execute  the system wide initialization file
              /etc/bash.bashrc and the personal initialization file  ~/.bashrc
              if  the  shell  is interactive.  This option is on by default if
              the shell is invoked as sh.

       --posix
              Change the behavior of bash where the default operation  differs
              from the POSIX standard to match the standard (posix mode).  See
              SEE ALSO below for a reference to a document  that  details  how
              posix mode affects bash's behavior.

       --restricted
              The shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).

       --verbose
              Equivalent to -v.

       --version
              Show  version information for this instance of bash on the stan-
              dard output and exit successfully.

COMMAND: python

DESCRIPTION: python  - an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming lan-
       guage

USAGE: python [ -B ] [ -b ] [ -d ] [ -E ] [ -h ] [ -i ] [ -I ]
              [ -m module-name ] [ -q ] [ -O ] [ -OO ] [ -P ] [ -s ] [ -S ]  [
       -u ]
              [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -W argument ] [ -x ] [ -X option ] [ -?  ]
              [ --check-hash-based-pycs default | always | never ]
              [ --help ] [ --help-env ] [ --help-xoptions ] [ --help-all ]
              [ -c command | script | - ] [ arguments ]

OPTIONS:
-B     Don't write .pyc files on import. See also  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTE-
              CODE.

       -b     Issue   warnings  about  str(bytes_instance),  str(bytearray_in-
              stance) and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue  er-
              rors)

       -c command
              Specify  the command to execute (see next section).  This termi-
              nates the option list (following options are passed as arguments
              to the command).

       --check-hash-based-pycs mode
              Configure  how Python evaluates the up-to-dateness of hash-based
              .pyc files.

       -d     Turn on parser debugging output (for expert only,  depending  on
              compilation options).

       -E     Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that
              modify the behavior of the interpreter.

       -h ,  -? ,  --help
              Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.

       --help-env
              Prints help about Python-specific environment variables and  ex-
              its.

       --help-xoptions
              Prints help about implementation-specific -X options and exits.

       --help-all
              Prints complete usage information and exits.

       -i     When  a  script  is passed as first argument or the -c option is
              used, enter interactive mode after executing the script  or  the
              command.  It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file.  This can be
              useful to inspect global variables  or  a  stack  trace  when  a
              script raises an exception.

       -I     Run Python in isolated mode. This also implies -E, -P and -s. In
              isolated mode sys.path contains neither the  script's  directory
              nor  the user's site-packages directory. All PYTHON* environment
              variables are ignored, too.  Further restrictions may be imposed
              to prevent the user from injecting malicious code.

       -m module-name
              Searches  sys.path for the named module and runs the correspond-
              ing .py file as a script. This terminates the option list  (fol-
              lowing options are passed as arguments to the module).

       -O     Remove  assert  statements and any code conditional on the value
              of __debug__; augment the filename for compiled (bytecode) files
              by adding .opt-1 before the .pyc extension.

       -OO    Do  -O and also discard docstrings; change the filename for com-
              piled (bytecode) files by adding .opt-2 before the  .pyc  exten-
              sion.

       -P     Don't   automatically  prepend  a  potentially  unsafe  path  to
              sys.path such as the current directory, the  script's  directory
              or  an  empty  string.  See  also the PYTHONSAFEPATH environment
              variable.

       -q     Do not print the version and copyright messages. These  messages
              are also suppressed in non-interactive mode.

       -s     Don't add user site directory to sys.path.

       -S     Disable the import of the module site and the site-dependent ma-
              nipulations of sys.path that it entails.  Also disable these ma-
              nipulations if site is explicitly imported later.

       -u     Force  the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered.  This op-
              tion has no effect on the stdin stream.

       -v     Print a message each time a module is initialized,  showing  the
              place  (filename  or  built-in  module) from which it is loaded.
              When given twice, print a message for each file that is  checked
              for  when  searching for a module.  Also provides information on
              module cleanup at exit.

       -V ,  --version
              Prints the Python version number of the  executable  and  exits.
              When given twice, print more information about the build.

       -W argument
              Warning  control.  Python's  warning machinery by default prints
              warning messages to sys.stderr.

              The simplest settings apply a particular action  unconditionally
              to all warnings emitted by a process (even those that are other-
              wise ignored by default):

                -Wdefault  # Warn once per call location
                -Werror    # Convert to exceptions
                -Walways   # Warn every time
                -Wmodule   # Warn once per calling module
                -Wonce     # Warn once per Python process
                -Wignore   # Never warn

              The action names can be abbreviated as desired  and  the  inter-
              preter will resolve them to the appropriate action name. For ex-
              ample, -Wi is the same as -Wignore .

              The  full  form  of  argument  is:  action:message:category:mod-
              ule:lineno

              Empty  fields  match  all  values;  trailing empty fields may be
              omitted. For example -W ignore::DeprecationWarning  ignores  all
              DeprecationWarning warnings.

              The action field is as explained above but only applies to warn-
              ings that match the remaining fields.

              The message field must match the whole printed warning  message;
              this match is case-insensitive.

              The  category  field matches the warning category (ex: "Depreca-
              tionWarning"). This must be a class name; the match test whether
              the  actual warning category of the message is a subclass of the
              specified warning category.

              The module field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this
              match is case-sensitive.

              The lineno field matches the line number, where zero matches all
              line numbers and is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.

              Multiple -W options can be given; when a  warning  matches  more
              than one option, the action for the last matching option is per-
              formed. Invalid -W options are ignored (though, a  warning  mes-
              sage  is printed about invalid options when the first warning is
              issued).

              Warnings can also be controlled using the  PYTHONWARNINGS  envi-
              ronment  variable  and  from  within  a Python program using the
              warnings module.   For  example,  the  warnings.filterwarnings()
              function  can be used to use a regular expression on the warning
              message.

       -X option
              Set implementation-specific option. The  following  options  are
              available:

                  -X faulthandler: enable faulthandler

                  -X showrefcount: output the total reference count and number
              of used
                      memory blocks when the program finishes  or  after  each
              statement in the
                      interactive interpreter. This only works on debug builds

                  -X  tracemalloc: start tracing Python memory allocations us-
              ing the
                      tracemalloc module. By default,  only  the  most  recent
              frame is stored in a
                      traceback of a trace. Use -X tracemalloc=NFRAME to start
              tracing with a
                      traceback limit of NFRAME frames

                  -X importtime: show how long each  import  takes.  It  shows
              module name,
                      cumulative time (including nested imports) and self time
              (excluding
                      nested imports). Note that its output may be  broken  in
              multi-threaded
                      application.  Typical  usage is python3 -X importtime -c
              'import asyncio'

                  -X dev: enable CPython's "development mode", introducing ad-
              ditional runtime
                      checks which are too expensive to be enabled by default.
              It will not be
                      more verbose than the default if the  code  is  correct:
              new warnings are
                      only  emitted  when  an issue is detected. Effect of the
              developer mode:
                         * Add default warning filter, as -W default
                         * Install debug hooks on memory allocators:  see  the
              PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()
                           C function
                         *  Enable  the faulthandler module to dump the Python
              traceback on a crash
                         * Enable asyncio debug mode
                         * Set the dev_mode attribute of sys.flags to True
                         * io.IOBase destructor logs close() exceptions

                  -X utf8: enable UTF-8 mode for operating system  interfaces,
              overriding the default
                      locale-aware  mode.  -X utf8=0 explicitly disables UTF-8
              mode (even when it would
                      otherwise activate automatically).  See  PYTHONUTF8  for
              more details

                  -X  pycache_prefix=PATH: enable writing .pyc files to a par-
              allel tree rooted at the
                      given directory instead of to the code tree.

                  -X warn_default_encoding: enable opt-in EncodingWarning  for
              'encoding=None'

                  -X no_debug_ranges: disable the inclusion of the tables map-
              ping extra location
                     information (end line, start column offset and end column
              offset) to every
                     instruction  in code objects. This is useful when smaller
              code objects and pyc
                     files are desired as well as suppressing the extra visual
              location indicators
                     when the interpreter displays tracebacks.

                  -X  frozen_modules=[on|off]:  whether  or not frozen modules
              should be used.
                     The default is "on" (or "off" if you are running a  local
              build).

                  -X  int_max_str_digits=number:  limit  the size of int<->str
              conversions.
                     This helps avoid denial of service attacks  when  parsing
              untrusted data.
                     The  default  is  sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits.  0
              disables.

       -x     Skip the first line of the source.  This is intended for  a  DOS
              specific hack only.  Warning: the line numbers in error messages
              will be off by one!

DESCRIPTION: python  - an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming lan-
       guage

USAGE: python [ -B ] [ -b ] [ -d ] [ -E ] [ -h ] [ -i ] [ -I ]
              [ -m module-name ] [ -q ] [ -O ] [ -OO ] [ -P ] [ -s ] [ -S ]  [
       -u ]
              [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -W argument ] [ -x ] [ -X option ] [ -?  ]
              [ --check-hash-based-pycs default | always | never ]
              [ --help ] [ --help-env ] [ --help-xoptions ] [ --help-all ]
              [ -c command | script | - ] [ arguments ]

OPTIONS:
-B     Don't write .pyc files on import. See also  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTE-
              CODE.

       -b     Issue   warnings  about  str(bytes_instance),  str(bytearray_in-
              stance) and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue  er-
              rors)

       -c command
              Specify  the command to execute (see next section).  This termi-
              nates the option list (following options are passed as arguments
              to the command).

       --check-hash-based-pycs mode
              Configure  how Python evaluates the up-to-dateness of hash-based
              .pyc files.

       -d     Turn on parser debugging output (for expert only,  depending  on
              compilation options).

       -E     Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that
              modify the behavior of the interpreter.

       -h ,  -? ,  --help
              Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.

       --help-env
              Prints help about Python-specific environment variables and  ex-
              its.

       --help-xoptions
              Prints help about implementation-specific -X options and exits.

       --help-all
              Prints complete usage information and exits.

       -i     When  a  script  is passed as first argument or the -c option is
              used, enter interactive mode after executing the script  or  the
              command.  It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file.  This can be
              useful to inspect global variables  or  a  stack  trace  when  a
              script raises an exception.

       -I     Run Python in isolated mode. This also implies -E, -P and -s. In
              isolated mode sys.path contains neither the  script's  directory
              nor  the user's site-packages directory. All PYTHON* environment
              variables are ignored, too.  Further restrictions may be imposed
              to prevent the user from injecting malicious code.

       -m module-name
              Searches  sys.path for the named module and runs the correspond-
              ing .py file as a script. This terminates the option list  (fol-
              lowing options are passed as arguments to the module).

       -O     Remove  assert  statements and any code conditional on the value
              of __debug__; augment the filename for compiled (bytecode) files
              by adding .opt-1 before the .pyc extension.

       -OO    Do  -O and also discard docstrings; change the filename for com-
              piled (bytecode) files by adding .opt-2 before the  .pyc  exten-
              sion.

       -P     Don't   automatically  prepend  a  potentially  unsafe  path  to
              sys.path such as the current directory, the  script's  directory
              or  an  empty  string.  See  also the PYTHONSAFEPATH environment
              variable.

       -q     Do not print the version and copyright messages. These  messages
              are also suppressed in non-interactive mode.

       -s     Don't add user site directory to sys.path.

       -S     Disable the import of the module site and the site-dependent ma-
              nipulations of sys.path that it entails.  Also disable these ma-
              nipulations if site is explicitly imported later.

       -u     Force  the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered.  This op-
              tion has no effect on the stdin stream.

       -v     Print a message each time a module is initialized,  showing  the
              place  (filename  or  built-in  module) from which it is loaded.
              When given twice, print a message for each file that is  checked
              for  when  searching for a module.  Also provides information on
              module cleanup at exit.

       -V ,  --version
              Prints the Python version number of the  executable  and  exits.
              When given twice, print more information about the build.

       -W argument
              Warning  control.  Python's  warning machinery by default prints
              warning messages to sys.stderr.

              The simplest settings apply a particular action  unconditionally
              to all warnings emitted by a process (even those that are other-
              wise ignored by default):

                -Wdefault  # Warn once per call location
                -Werror    # Convert to exceptions
                -Walways   # Warn every time
                -Wmodule   # Warn once per calling module
                -Wonce     # Warn once per Python process
                -Wignore   # Never warn

              The action names can be abbreviated as desired  and  the  inter-
              preter will resolve them to the appropriate action name. For ex-
              ample, -Wi is the same as -Wignore .

              The  full  form  of  argument  is:  action:message:category:mod-
              ule:lineno

              Empty  fields  match  all  values;  trailing empty fields may be
              omitted. For example -W ignore::DeprecationWarning  ignores  all
              DeprecationWarning warnings.

              The action field is as explained above but only applies to warn-
              ings that match the remaining fields.

              The message field must match the whole printed warning  message;
              this match is case-insensitive.

              The  category  field matches the warning category (ex: "Depreca-
              tionWarning"). This must be a class name; the match test whether
              the  actual warning category of the message is a subclass of the
              specified warning category.

              The module field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this
              match is case-sensitive.

              The lineno field matches the line number, where zero matches all
              line numbers and is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.

              Multiple -W options can be given; when a  warning  matches  more
              than one option, the action for the last matching option is per-
              formed. Invalid -W options are ignored (though, a  warning  mes-
              sage  is printed about invalid options when the first warning is
              issued).

              Warnings can also be controlled using the  PYTHONWARNINGS  envi-
              ronment  variable  and  from  within  a Python program using the
              warnings module.   For  example,  the  warnings.filterwarnings()
              function  can be used to use a regular expression on the warning
              message.

       -X option
              Set implementation-specific option. The  following  options  are
              available:

                  -X faulthandler: enable faulthandler

                  -X showrefcount: output the total reference count and number
              of used
                      memory blocks when the program finishes  or  after  each
              statement in the
                      interactive interpreter. This only works on debug builds

                  -X  tracemalloc: start tracing Python memory allocations us-
              ing the
                      tracemalloc module. By default,  only  the  most  recent
              frame is stored in a
                      traceback of a trace. Use -X tracemalloc=NFRAME to start
              tracing with a
                      traceback limit of NFRAME frames

                  -X importtime: show how long each  import  takes.  It  shows
              module name,
                      cumulative time (including nested imports) and self time
              (excluding
                      nested imports). Note that its output may be  broken  in
              multi-threaded
                      application.  Typical  usage is python3 -X importtime -c
              'import asyncio'

                  -X dev: enable CPython's "development mode", introducing ad-
              ditional runtime
                      checks which are too expensive to be enabled by default.
              It will not be
                      more verbose than the default if the  code  is  correct:
              new warnings are
                      only  emitted  when  an issue is detected. Effect of the
              developer mode:
                         * Add default warning filter, as -W default
                         * Install debug hooks on memory allocators:  see  the
              PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()
                           C function
                         *  Enable  the faulthandler module to dump the Python
              traceback on a crash
                         * Enable asyncio debug mode
                         * Set the dev_mode attribute of sys.flags to True
                         * io.IOBase destructor logs close() exceptions

                  -X utf8: enable UTF-8 mode for operating system  interfaces,
              overriding the default
                      locale-aware  mode.  -X utf8=0 explicitly disables UTF-8
              mode (even when it would
                      otherwise activate automatically).  See  PYTHONUTF8  for
              more details

                  -X  pycache_prefix=PATH: enable writing .pyc files to a par-
              allel tree rooted at the
                      given directory instead of to the code tree.

                  -X warn_default_encoding: enable opt-in EncodingWarning  for
              'encoding=None'

                  -X no_debug_ranges: disable the inclusion of the tables map-
              ping extra location
                     information (end line, start column offset and end column
              offset) to every
                     instruction  in code objects. This is useful when smaller
              code objects and pyc
                     files are desired as well as suppressing the extra visual
              location indicators
                     when the interpreter displays tracebacks.

                  -X  frozen_modules=[on|off]:  whether  or not frozen modules
              should be used.
                     The default is "on" (or "off" if you are running a  local
              build).

                  -X  int_max_str_digits=number:  limit  the size of int<->str
              conversions.
                     This helps avoid denial of service attacks  when  parsing
              untrusted data.
                     The  default  is  sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits.  0
              disables.

       -x     Skip the first line of the source.  This is intended for  a  DOS
              specific hack only.  Warning: the line numbers in error messages
              will be off by one!

COMMAND: ruby

DESCRIPTION: ruby -- Interpreted object-oriented scripting language

USAGE: ruby [--copyright] [--version] [-SUacdlnpswvy] [-0[octal]] [-C directory]
          [-E external[:internal]] [-F[pattern]] [-I directory] [-K[c]]
          [-T[level]] [-W[level]] [-e command] [-i[extension]] [-r library]
          [-x[directory]] [--{enable|disable}-FEATURE] [--dump=target]
          [--verbose] [--] [program_file] [argument ...]

OPTIONS:
The Ruby interpreter accepts the following command-line options
     (switches).  They are quite similar to those of perl(1).

     --copyright    Prints the copyright notice, and quits immediately without
                    running any script.

     --version      Prints the version of the Ruby interpreter, and quits im-
                    mediately without running any script.

     -0[octal]      (The digit "zero".)  Specifies the input record separator
                    ($/) as an octal number. If no digit is given, the null
                    character is taken as the separator.  Other switches may
                    follow the digits.  -00 turns Ruby into paragraph mode.
                    -0777 makes Ruby read whole file at once as a single
                    string since there is no legal character with that value.

     -C directory
     -X directory   Causes Ruby to switch to the directory.

     -E external[:internal]
     --encoding external[:internal]
                    Specifies the default value(s) for external encodings and
                    internal encoding. Values should be separated with colon
                    (:).

                    You can omit the one for internal encodings, then the
                    value (Encoding.default_internal) will be nil.

     --external-encoding=encoding
     --internal-encoding=encoding
                    Specify the default external or internal character encod-
                    ing

     -F pattern     Specifies input field separator ($;).

     -I directory   Used to tell Ruby where to load the library scripts.  Di-
                    rectory path will be added to the load-path variable ($:).

     -K kcode       Specifies KANJI (Japanese) encoding. The default value for
                    script encodings (__ENCODING__) and external encodings
                    (Encoding.default_external) will be the specified one.
                    kcode can be one of

                          e       EUC-JP

                          s       Windows-31J (CP932)

                          u       UTF-8

                          n       ASCII-8BIT (BINARY)

     -S             Makes Ruby use the PATH environment variable to search for
                    script, unless its name begins with a slash.  This is used
                    to emulate #! on machines that don't support it, in the
                    following manner:

                          #! /usr/local/bin/ruby
                          # This line makes the next one a comment in Ruby \
                            exec /usr/local/bin/ruby -S $0 $*

                    On some systems $0 does not always contain the full path-
                    name, so you need the -S switch to tell Ruby to search for
                    the script if necessary (to handle embedded spaces and
                    such).  A better construct than $* would be ${1+"$@"}, but
                    it does not work if the script is being interpreted by
                    csh(1).

     -T[level=1]    Turns on taint checks at the specified level (default 1).

     -U             Sets the default value for internal encodings
                    (Encoding.default_internal) to UTF-8.

     -W[level=2]    Turns on verbose mode at the specified level without
                    printing the version message at the beginning. The level
                    can be;

                          0       Verbose mode is "silence". It sets the
                                  $VERBOSE to nil.

                          1       Verbose mode is "medium". It sets the
                                  $VERBOSE to false.

                          2 (default) Verbose mode is "verbose". It sets the
                                  $VERBOSE to true.  -W2 is the same as -w

     -a             Turns on auto-split mode when used with -n or -p.  In
                    auto-split mode, Ruby executes
                          $F = $_.split
                    at beginning of each loop.

     -c             Causes Ruby to check the syntax of the script and exit
                    without executing. If there are no syntax errors, Ruby
                    will print "Syntax OK" to the standard output.

     -d
     --debug        Turns on debug mode.  $DEBUG will be set to true.

     -e command     Specifies script from command-line while telling Ruby not
                    to search the rest of the arguments for a script file
                    name.

     -h
     --help         Prints a summary of the options.

     -i extension   Specifies in-place-edit mode.  The extension, if speci-
                    fied, is added to old file name to make a backup copy.
                    For example:

                          % echo matz > /tmp/junk
                          % cat /tmp/junk
                          matz
                          % ruby -p -i.bak -e '$_.upcase!' /tmp/junk
                          % cat /tmp/junk
                          MATZ
                          % cat /tmp/junk.bak
                          matz

     -l             (The lowercase letter "ell".)  Enables automatic line-end-
                    ing processing, which means to firstly set $\ to the value
                    of $/, and secondly chops every line read using chomp!.

     -n             Causes Ruby to assume the following loop around your
                    script, which makes it iterate over file name arguments
                    somewhat like sed -n or awk.

                          while gets
                            ...
                          end

     -p             Acts mostly same as -n switch, but print the value of
                    variable $_ at the each end of the loop.  For example:

                          % echo matz | ruby -p -e '$_.tr! "a-z", "A-Z"'
                          MATZ

     -r library     Causes Ruby to load the library using require.  It is use-
                    ful when using -n or -p.

     -s             Enables some switch parsing for switches after script name
                    but before any file name arguments (or before a --).  Any
                    switches found there are removed from ARGV and set the
                    corresponding variable in the script.  For example:

                          #! /usr/local/bin/ruby -s
                          # prints "true" if invoked with `-xyz' switch.
                          print "true\n" if $xyz

     -v             Enables verbose mode.  Ruby will print its version at the
                    beginning and set the variable $VERBOSE to true.  Some
                    methods print extra messages if this variable is true.  If
                    this switch is given, and no other switches are present,
                    Ruby quits after printing its version.

     -w             Enables verbose mode without printing version message at
                    the beginning.  It sets the $VERBOSE variable to true.

     -x[directory]  Tells Ruby that the script is embedded in a message.
                    Leading garbage will be discarded until the first line
                    that starts with "#!" and contains the string, "ruby".
                    Any meaningful switches on that line will be applied.  The
                    end of the script must be specified with either EOF, ^D
                    (control-D), ^Z (control-Z), or the reserved word __END__.
                    If the directory name is specified, Ruby will switch to
                    that directory before executing script.

     -y
     --yydebug      DO NOT USE.

                    Turns on compiler debug mode.  Ruby will print a bunch of
                    internal state messages during compilation.  Only specify
                    this switch you are going to debug the Ruby interpreter.

     --disable-FEATURE
     --enable-FEATURE
                    Disables (or enables) the specified FEATURE.
                    --disable-gems
                    --enable-gems      Disables (or enables) RubyGems li-
                                       braries.  By default, Ruby will load
                                       the latest version of each installed
                                       gem. The Gem constant is true if
                                       RubyGems is enabled, false if other-
                                       wise.

                    --disable-rubyopt
                    --enable-rubyopt   Ignores (or considers) the RUBYOPT en-
                                       vironment variable. By default, Ruby
                                       considers the variable.

                    --disable-all
                    --enable-all       Disables (or enables) all features.

     --dump=target  Dump some information.

                    Prints the specified target.  target can be one of;

                          version version description same as --version

                          usage   brief usage message same as -h

                          help    Show long help message same as --help

                          syntax  check of syntax same as -c --yydebug

                          yydebug compiler debug mode, same as --yydebug

                                  Only specify this switch if you are going to
                                  debug the Ruby interpreter.

                          parsetree

                          parsetree_with_comment AST nodes tree

                                  Only specify this switch if you are going to
                                  debug the Ruby interpreter.

                          insns   disassembled instructions

                                  Only specify this switch if you are going to
                                  debug the Ruby interpreter.

     --verbose      Enables verbose mode without printing version message at
                    the beginning.  It sets the $VERBOSE variable to true.  If
                    this switch is given, and no script arguments (script file
                    or -e options) are present, Ruby quits immediately.

COMMAND: java

DESCRIPTION: java - launch a Java application

USAGE: To launch a class file:

       java [options] mainclass [args ...]

       To launch the main class in a JAR file:

       java [options] -jar jarfile [args ...]

       To launch the main class in a module:

       java [options] -m module[/mainclass] [args ...]

       or

       java [options] --module module[/mainclass] [args ...]

       To launch a single source-file program:

       java [options] source-file [args ...]

       options
              Optional:  Specifies  command-line  options separated by spaces.
              See Overview of Java Options for a description of available  op-
              tions.

       mainclass
              Specifies  the  name  of the class to be launched.  Command-line
              entries following classname are the arguments for the main meth-
              od.

       -jar jarfile
              Executes  a program encapsulated in a JAR file.  The jarfile ar-
              gument is the name of a JAR file with a manifest that contains a
              line  in  the  form  Main-Class:classname that defines the class
              with  the  public static void main(String[] args)  method   that
              serves as your application's starting point.  When you use -jar,
              the specified JAR file is the source of all  user  classes,  and
              other  class  path  settings  are  ignored.  If you're using JAR
              files, then see jar.

       -m or --module module[/mainclass]
              Executes the main class in a module specified by mainclass if it
              is  given,  or, if it is not given, the value in the module.  In
              other words, mainclass can be used when it is not  specified  by
              the module, or to override the value when it is specified.

              See Standard Options for Java.

       source-file
              Only used to launch a single source-file program.  Specifies the
              source file that contains the main class when using  source-file
              mode.    See   Using  Source-File  Mode  to  Launch  Single-File
              Source-Code Programs

       args ...
              Optional:  Arguments  following  mainclass,  source-file,   -jar
              jarfile, and -m or --module module/mainclass are passed as argu-
              ments to the main class.

OPTIONS:
The java command supports a wide range of options in the following cat-
       egories:

       o Standard Options for Java: Options guaranteed to be supported by  all
         implementations  of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  They're used for
         common actions, such as checking the version of the JRE, setting  the
         class path, enabling verbose output, and so on.

       o Extra  Options for Java: General purpose options that are specific to
         the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine.  They aren't guaranteed to be  sup-
         ported  by all JVM implementations, and are subject to change.  These
         options start with -X.

       The advanced options aren't recommended for casual use.  These are  de-
       veloper options used for tuning specific areas of the Java HotSpot Vir-
       tual Machine operation that often have specific system requirements and
       may require privileged access to system configuration parameters.  Sev-
       eral examples of performance tuning are provided in Performance  Tuning
       Examples.   These  options aren't guaranteed to be supported by all JVM
       implementations and are subject to change.  Advanced options start with
       -XX.

       o Advanced  Runtime  Options  for Java: Control the runtime behavior of
         the Java HotSpot VM.

       o Advanced  JIT  Compiler  Options  for  java:  Control   the   dynamic
         just-in-time (JIT) compilation performed by the Java HotSpot VM.

       o Advanced Serviceability Options for Java: Enable gathering system in-
         formation and performing extensive debugging.

       o Advanced Garbage Collection Options for  Java:  Control  how  garbage
         collection (GC) is performed by the Java HotSpot

       Boolean  options are used to either enable a feature that's disabled by
       default or disable a feature that's enabled by default.   Such  options
       don't  require  a parameter.  Boolean -XX options are enabled using the
       plus sign (-XX:+OptionName) and disabled using the minus sign (-XX:-Op-
       tionName).

       For  options  that  require  an argument, the argument may be separated
       from the option name by a space, a colon (:), or an equal sign (=),  or
       the  argument  may directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs
       for each option).  If you're expected to specify  the  size  in  bytes,
       then  you  can  use  no  suffix, or use the suffix k or K for kilobytes
       (KB), m or M for megabytes (MB), or g or G for gigabytes (GB).  For ex-
       ample,  to  set  the  size  to  8 GB, you can specify either 8g, 8192m,
       8388608k, or 8589934592 as the argument.  If you are expected to speci-
       fy the percentage, then use a number from 0 to 1.  For example, specify
       0.25 for 25%.

       The following sections describe the options that are  obsolete,  depre-
       cated, and removed:

       o Deprecated Java Options: Accepted and acted upon --- a warning is is-
         sued when they're used.

       o Obsolete Java Options: Accepted but ignored --- a warning  is  issued
         when they're used.

       o Removed Java Options: Removed --- using them results in an error.

     node inspect [-e string | script.js | - | <host>:<port>] ...
     node [--v8-options]

OPTIONS:
-       Alias for stdin, analogous to the use of - in other command-line
             utilities.  The executed script is read from stdin, and remaining
             arguments are passed to the script.

     --      Indicate the end of command-line options.  Pass the rest of the
             arguments to the script.

             If no script filename or eval/print script is supplied prior to
             this, then the next argument will be used as a script filename.

     --abort-on-uncaught-exception
             Aborting instead of exiting causes a core file to be generated
             for analysis.

     --completion-bash
             Print source-able bash completion script for Node.js.

     -C, --conditions string
             Use custom conditional exports conditions.  string

     --cpu-prof
             Start the V8 CPU profiler on start up, and write the CPU profile
             to disk before exit. If --cpu-prof-dir is not specified, the pro-
             file will be written to the current working directory with a gen-
             erated file name.

     --cpu-prof-dir
             The directory where the CPU profiles generated by --cpu-prof will
             be placed.  The default value is controlled by the
             --diagnostic-dir.  command-line option.

     --cpu-prof-interval
             The sampling interval in microseconds for the CPU profiles gener-
             ated by --cpu-prof.  The default is 1000.

     --cpu-prof-name
             File name of the V8 CPU profile generated with --cpu-prof.

     --diagnostic-dir
             Set the directory for all diagnostic output files.  Default is
             current working directory.  Set the directory to which all diag-
             nostic output files will be written to.  Defaults to current
             working directory.  Affects the default output directory of:
             --cpu-prof-dir.  --heap-prof-dir.  --redirect-warnings.

     --disable-proto=mode
             Disable the `Object.prototype.__proto__` property. If mode is
             `delete`, the property will be removed entirely. If mode is
             `throw`, accesses to the property will throw an exception with
             the code `ERR_PROTO_ACCESS`.

     --disallow-code-generation-from-strings
             Make built-in language features like `eval` and `new Function`
             that generate code from strings throw an exception instead. This
             does not affect the Node.js `vm` module.

     --enable-fips
             Enable FIPS-compliant crypto at startup.  Requires Node.js to be
             built with ./configure --openssl-fips.

     --heapsnapshot-near-heap-limit=max_count
             Generate heap snapshot when the V8 heap usage is approaching the
             heap limit.  No more than the specified number of snapshots will
             be generated.

     --heapsnapshot-signal=signal
             Generate heap snapshot on specified signal.

     --heap-prof
             Start the V8 heap profiler on start up, and write the heap pro-
             file to disk before exit. If --heap-prof-dir is not specified,
             the profile will be written to the current working directory with
             a generated file name.

     --heap-prof-dir
             The directory where the heap profiles generated by --heap-prof
             will be placed.  The default value is controlled by the
             --diagnostic-dir.  command-line option.

     --inspect-publish-uid=stderr,http
             Specify how the inspector WebSocket URL is exposed.  Valid values
             are stderr and http.  Default is stderr,http.

     --inspect=[host:]port
             Activate inspector on host:port.  Default is 127.0.0.1:9229.

             V8 Inspector integration allows attaching Chrome DevTools and
             IDEs to Node.js instances for debugging and profiling.  It uses
             the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

     --insecure-http-parser
             Use an insecure HTTP parser that accepts invalid HTTP headers.
             This may allow interoperability with non-conformant HTTP imple-
             mentations. It may also allow request smuggling and other HTTP
             attacks that rely on invalid headers being accepted. Avoid using
             this option.

     --jitless
             Disable runtime allocation of executable memory. This may be re-
             quired on some platforms for security reasons. It can also reduce
             attack surface on other platforms, but the performance impact may
             be severe.

             This flag is inherited from V8 and is subject to change upstream.
             It may disappear in a non-semver-major release.

     --max-http-header-size=size
             Specify the maximum size of HTTP headers in bytes. Defaults to 16
             KiB.

     --napi-modules
             This option is a no-op.  It is kept for compatibility.

     --no-deprecation
             Silence deprecation warnings.

     --no-extra-info-on-fatal-exception
             Hide extra information on fatal exception that causes exit.

     --no-force-async-hooks-checks
             Disable runtime checks for `async_hooks`.  These will still be
             enabled dynamically when `async_hooks` is enabled.

     --no-addons
             Disable the `node-addons` exports condition as well as disable
             loading native addons. When `--no-addons` is specified, calling
             `process.dlopen` or requiring a native C++ addon will fail and
             throw an exception.

     --no-global-search-paths
             Do not search modules from global paths.

     --no-warnings
             Silence all process warnings (including deprecations).

     --node-memory-debug
             Enable extra debug checks for memory leaks in Node.js internals.
             This is usually only useful for developers debugging Node.js it-
             self.

     --openssl-config=file
             Load an OpenSSL configuration file on startup.  Among other uses,
             this can be used to enable FIPS-compliant crypto if Node.js is
             built with ./configure --openssl-fips.

     --pending-deprecation
             Emit pending deprecation warnings.

     --policy-integrity=sri
             Instructs Node.js to error prior to running any code if the pol-
             icy does not have the specified integrity. It expects a Subre-
             source Integrity string as a parameter.

     --preserve-symlinks
             Instructs the module loader to preserve symbolic links when re-
             solving and caching modules other than the main module.

     --preserve-symlinks-main
             Instructs the module loader to preserve symbolic links when re-
             solving and caching the main module.

     --prof  Generate V8 profiler output.

     --prof-process
             Process V8 profiler output generated using the V8 option --prof.

     --redirect-warnings=file
             Write process warnings to the given file instead of printing to
             stderr.

     --report-compact
             Write diagnostic reports in a compact format, single-line JSON.

     --report-dir --report-directory
             Location at which the diagnostic report will be generated.  The
             `file` name may be an absolute path. If it is not, the default
             directory it will be written to is controlled by the
             --diagnostic-dir.  command-line option.

     --report-filename
             Name of the file to which the diagnostic report will be written.

     --report-on-fatalerror
             Enables the diagnostic report to be triggered on fatal errors
             (internal errors within the Node.js runtime such as out of mem-
             ory) that leads to termination of the application. Useful to in-
             spect various diagnostic data elements such as heap, stack, event
             loop state, resource consumption etc. to reason about the fatal
             error.

     --report-on-signal
             Enables diagnostic report to be generated upon receiving the
             specified (or predefined) signal to the running Node.js process.
             Default signal is SIGUSR2.

     --report-signal
             Sets or resets the signal for diagnostic report generation (not
             supported on Windows). Default signal is SIGUSR2.

     --report-uncaught-exception
             Enables diagnostic report to be generated on un-caught excep-
             tions. Useful when inspecting JavaScript stack in conjunction
             with native stack and other runtime environment data.

     --secure-heap=n
             Specify the size of the OpenSSL secure heap. Any value less than
             2 disables the secure heap. The default is 0. The value must be a
             power of two.

     --secure-heap-min=n
             Specify the minimum allocation from the OpenSSL secure heap. The
             default is 2. The value must be a power of two.

     --test  Starts the Node.js command line test runner.

     --test-concurrency
             The maximum number of test files that the test runner CLI will
             execute concurrently.

     --test-name-pattern
             A regular expression that configures the test runner to only exe-
             cute tests whose name matches the provided pattern.

     --test-reporter
             A test reporter to use when running tests.

     --test-reporter-destination
             The destination for the corresponding test reporter.

     --test-only
             Configures the test runner to only execute top level tests that
             have the `only` option set.

     --test-shard
             Test suite shard to execute in a format of <index>/<total>.

     --throw-deprecation
             Throw errors for deprecations.

     --title=title
             Specify process.title on startup.

     --tls-cipher-list=list
             Specify an alternative default TLS cipher list.  Requires Node.js
             to be built with crypto support. (Default)

     --tls-keylog=file
             Log TLS key material to a file. The key material is in NSS SS-
             LKEYLOGFILE format and can be used by software (such as Wire-
             shark) to decrypt the TLS traffic.

     --tls-max-v1.2
             Set default  maxVersion to 'TLSv1.2'. Use to disable support for
             TLSv1.3.

     --tls-max-v1.3
             Set default  maxVersion to 'TLSv1.3'. Use to enable support for
             TLSv1.3.

     --tls-min-v1.0
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1'. Use for compatibility with old
             TLS clients or servers.

     --tls-min-v1.1
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1.1'. Use for compatibility with
             old TLS clients or servers.

     --tls-min-v1.2
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1.2'. This is the default for 12.x
             and later, but the option is supported for compatibility with
             older Node.js versions.

     --tls-min-v1.3
             Set default minVersion to 'TLSv1.3'. Use to disable support for
             TLSv1.2 in favour of TLSv1.3, which is more secure.

     --trace-atomics-wait
             Print short summaries of calls to Atomics.wait().  This flag is
             deprecated.

     --trace-deprecation
             Print stack traces for deprecations.

     --trace-event-categories categories
             A comma-separated list of categories that should be traced when
             trace event tracing is enabled using --trace-events-enabled.

     --trace-event-file-pattern pattern
             Template string specifying the filepath for the trace event data,
             it supports ${rotation} and ${pid}.

     --trace-events-enabled
             Enable the collection of trace event tracing information.

     --trace-exit
             Prints a stack trace whenever an environment is exited proac-
             tively, i.e. invoking `process.exit()`.

     --trace-sigint
             Prints a stack trace on SIGINT.

     --trace-sync-io
             Print a stack trace whenever synchronous I/O is detected after
             the first turn of the event loop.

     --trace-tls
             Prints TLS packet trace information to stderr.

     --trace-uncaught
             Print stack traces for uncaught exceptions; usually, the stack
             trace associated with the creation of an Error is printed,
             whereas this makes Node.js also print the stack trace associated
             with throwing the value (which does not need to be an Error in-
             stance).

             Enabling this option may affect garbage collection behavior nega-
             tively.

     --trace-warnings
             Print stack traces for process warnings (including deprecations).

     --track-heap-objects
             Track heap object allocations for heap snapshots.

     --unhandled-rejections=mode
             Define the behavior for unhandled rejections. Can be one of
             `strict` (raise an error), `warn` (enforce warnings) or `none`
             (silence warnings).

     --use-bundled-ca, --use-openssl-ca
             Use bundled Mozilla CA store as supplied by current Node.js ver-
             sion or use OpenSSL's default CA store.  The default store is se-
             lectable at build-time.

             The bundled CA store, as supplied by Node.js, is a snapshot of
             Mozilla CA store that is fixed at release time.  It is identical
             on all supported platforms.

             Using OpenSSL store allows for external modifications of the
             store.  For most Linux and BSD distributions, this store is main-
             tained by the distribution maintainers and system administrators.
             OpenSSL CA store location is dependent on configuration of the
             OpenSSL library but this can be altered at runtime using environ-
             ment variables.

             See SSL_CERT_DIR and SSL_CERT_FILE.

     --use-largepages=mode
             Re-map the Node.js static code to large memory pages at startup.
             If supported on the target system, this will cause the Node.js
             static code to be moved onto 2 MiB pages instead of 4 KiB pages.

             mode must have one of the following values: `off` (the default
             value, meaning do not map), `on` (map and ignore failure, report-
             ing it to stderr), or `silent` (map and silently ignore failure).

     --v8-options
             Print V8 command-line options.

     --v8-pool-size=num
             Set V8's thread pool size which will be used to allocate back-
             ground jobs.  If set to 0 then V8 will choose an appropriate size
             of the thread pool based on the number of online processors.  If
             the value provided is larger than V8's maximum, then the largest
             value will be chosen.

     --zero-fill-buffers
             Automatically zero-fills all newly allocated Buffer and Slow-
             Buffer instances.

     -c, --check
             Check the script's syntax without executing it.  Exits with an
             error code if script is invalid.

     -e, --eval string
             Evaluate string as JavaScript.

     -h, --help
             Print command-line options.  The output of this option is less
             detailed than this document.

     -i, --interactive
             Open the REPL even if stdin does not appear to be a terminal.

     -p, --print string
             Identical to -e, but prints the result.

     -r, --require module
             Preload the specified module at startup.  Follows `require()`'s
             module resolution rules.  module may be either a path to a file,
             or a Node.js module name.

     -v, --version
             Print node's version.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:

=== 
COMMAND: mysql

DESCRIPTION: mariadb - the MariaDB command-line tool (mysql is now a symlink to
       mariadb)

USAGE: mysql [options] db_name

OPTIONS:
mysql supports the following options, which can be specified on the
       command line or in the [mysql], [client], [client-server] or [client-
       mariadb] option file groups.  mysql also supports the options for
       processing option files.

       o   --help, -?, -I

           Display a help message and exit.

       o   --abort-source-on-error

           Abort 'source filename' operations in case of errors.

       o   --auto-rehash

           Enable automatic rehashing. This option is on by default, which
           enables database, table, and column name completion. Use
           --disable-auto-rehash, --no-auto-rehash,  or --skip-auto-rehash to
           disable rehashing. That causes mysql to start faster, but you must
           issue the rehash command if you want to use name completion.

           To complete a name, enter the first part and press Tab. If the name
           is unambiguous, mysql completes it. Otherwise, you can press Tab
           again to see the possible names that begin with what you have typed
           so far. Completion does not occur if there is no default database.

       o   --auto-vertical-output

           Automatically switch to vertical output mode if the result is wider
           than the terminal width.

       o   --batch, -B

           Print results using tab as the column separator, with each row on a
           new line. With this option, mysql does not use the history file.

           Batch mode results in nontabular output format and escaping of
           special characters. Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see
           the description for the --raw option.

       o   --binary-mode

           Binary mode allows certain character sequences to be processed as
           data that would otherwise be treated with a special meaning by the
           parser.  Specifically, this switch turns off parsing of all client
           commands except \C and DELIMITER in non-interactive mode (i.e.,
           when binary mode is combined with either 1) piped input, 2) the
           --batch mysql option, or 3) the 'source' command). Also, in binary
           mode, occurrences of '\r\n' and ASCII '\0' are preserved within
           strings, whereas by default, '\r\n' is translated to '\n' and '\0'
           is disallowed in user input.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

           The directory where character sets are installed.

       o   --column-names

           Write column names in results.

       o   --column-type-info, -m

           Display result set metadata.

       o   --comments, -c

           Whether to preserve comments in statements sent to the server. The
           default is --skip-comments (discard comments), enable with
           --comments (preserve comments).

       o   --compress, -C

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
           both support compression.

       o   --connect-timeout=seconds

           Set the number of seconds before connection timeout. (Default value
           is 0.)

       o   --database=db_name, -D db_name

           The database to use.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           'd:t:o,file_name'. The default is 'd:t:o,/tmp/mysql.trace'.

       o   --debug-check

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       o   --debug-info, -T

           Prints debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
           when the program exits.

       o   --default-auth=name

           Default authentication client-side plugin to use.

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

           Use charset_name as the default character set for the client and
           connection.

           A common issue that can occur when the operating system uses utf8
           or another multi-byte character set is that output from the mysql
           client is formatted incorrectly, due to the fact that the MariaDB
           client uses the latin1 character set by default. You can usually
           fix such issues by using this option to force the client to use the
           system character set instead.

       o   --defaults-extra-file=filename

           Set filename as the file to read default options from after the
           global defaults files has been read.  Must be given as first
           option.

       o   --defaults-file=filename

           Set filename as the file to read default options from, override
           global defaults files. Must be given as first option.

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=suffix

           In addition to the groups named on the command line, read groups
           that have the given suffix.

       o   --delimiter=str

           Set the statement delimiter. The default is the semicolon character
           (";").

       o   --disable-named-commands

           Disable named commands. Use the \* form only, or use named commands
           only at the beginning of a line ending with a semicolon (";").
           mysql starts with this option enabled by default. However, even
           with this option, long-format commands still work from the first
           line. See the section called "MYSQL COMMANDS".

       o   --enable-cleartext-plugin

           Obsolete option. Exists only for MySQL compatibility.

       o   --execute=statement, -e statement

           Execute the statement and quit. Disables --force and history file.
           The default output format is like that produced with --batch.

       o   --force, -f

           Continue even if an SQL error occurs. Sets --abort-source-on-error
           to 0.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.

       o   --html, -H

           Produce HTML output.

       o   --ignore-spaces, -i

           Ignore spaces after function names. Allows one to have spaces
           (including tab characters and new line characters) between function
           name and '('. The drawback is that this causes built in functions
           to become reserved words.

       o   --init-command=str

           SQL Command to execute when connecting to the MariaDB server. Will
           automatically be re-executed when reconnecting.

       o   --line-numbers

           Write line numbers for errors. Disable this with
           --skip-line-numbers.

       o   --local-infile[={0|1}]

           Enable or disable LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA INFILE. With no
           value, the option enables LOCAL. The option may be given as
           --local-infile=0 or --local-infile=1 to explicitly disable or
           enable LOCAL. Enabling LOCAL has no effect if the server does not
           also support it.

       o   --max-allowed-packet=num

           Set the maximum packet length to send to or receive from the
           server. (Default value is 16MB, largest 1GB.)

       o   --max-join-size=num

           Set the automatic limit for rows in a join when using
           --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000,000.)

       o   --named-commands, -G

           Enable named mysql commands. Long-format commands are allowed, not
           just short-format commands. For example, quit and \q both are
           recognized. Use --skip-named-commands to disable named commands.
           See the section called "MYSQL COMMANDS". Disabled by default.

       o   --net-buffer-length=size

           Set the buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. (Default
           value is 16KB.)

       o   --no-auto-rehash, -A

           This has the same effect as --skip-auto-rehash. See the description
           for --auto-rehash.

       o   --no-beep, -b

           Do not beep when errors occur.

       o   --no-defaults

           Do not read default options from any option file. This must be
           given as the first argument.

       o   --one-database, -o

           Ignore statements except those those that occur while the default
           database is the one named on the command line. This filtering is
           limited, and based only on USE statements. This is useful for
           skipping updates to other databases in the binary log.

       o   --pager[=command]

           Use the given command for paging query output. If the command is
           omitted, the default pager is the value of your PAGER environment
           variable. Valid pagers are less, more, cat [> filename], and so
           forth. This option works only on Unix and only in interactive mode.
           To disable paging, use --skip-pager.  the section called "MYSQL
           COMMANDS", discusses output paging further.

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
           and the password. If you omit the password value following the
           --password or -p option on the command line, mysql prompts for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --plugin-dir=dir_name

           Directory for client-side plugins.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection or 0 for default
           to, in order of preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT, /etc/services,
           built-in default (3306).  Forces --protocol=tcp when specified on
           the command line without other connection properties.

       o   --print-defaults

           Print the program argument list and exit. This must be given as the
           first argument.

       o   --progress-reports

           Get progress reports for long running commands (such as ALTER
           TABLE). (Defaults to on; use --skip-progress-reports to disable.)

       o   --prompt=format_str

           Set the prompt to the specified format. The special sequences that
           the prompt can contain are described in the section called "MYSQL
           COMMANDS".

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
           useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
           protocol to be used other than the one you want.

       o   --quick, -q

           Do not cache each query result, print each row as it is received.
           This may slow down the server if the output is suspended. With this
           option, mysql does not use the history file.

       o   --raw, -r

           For tabular output, the "boxing" around columns enables one column
           value to be distinguished from another. For nontabular output (such
           as is produced in batch mode or when the --batch or --silent option
           is given), special characters are escaped in the output so they can
           be identified easily. Newline, tab, NUL, and backslash are written
           as \n, \t, \0, and \\. The --raw option disables this character
           escaping.

           The following example demonstrates tabular versus nontabular output
           and the use of raw mode to disable escaping:

               % mysql
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               +----------+
               | CHAR(92) |
               +----------+
               | \        |
               +----------+
               % mysql -s
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               CHAR(92)
               \\
               % mysql -s -r
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               CHAR(92)
               \

       o   --reconnect

           If the connection to the server is lost, automatically try to
           reconnect. A single reconnect attempt is made each time the
           connection is lost. Enabled by default, to disable use
           --skip-reconnect or --disable-reconnect.

       o   --safe-updates, --i-am-a-dummy, -U

           Allow only those UPDATE and DELETE statements that specify which
           rows to modify by using key values. If you have set this option in
           an option file, you can override it by using --safe-updates on the
           command line. See the section called "MYSQL TIPS", for more
           information about this option.

       o   --secure-auth

           Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1.1) format. This
           prevents connections except for servers that use the newer password
           format.

       o   --select-limit=limit

           Set automatic limit for SELECT when using --safe-updates. (Default
           value is 1,000.)

       o   --server-arg=name

           Send name as a parameter to the embedded server.

       o   --show-warnings

           Cause warnings to be shown after each statement if there are any.
           This option applies to interactive and batch mode.

       o   --sigint-ignore

           Ignore SIGINT signals (typically the result of typing Control-C).

       o   --silent, -s

           Silent mode. Produce less output. This option can be given multiple
           times to produce less and less output.

           This option results in nontabular output format and escaping of
           special characters. Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see
           the description for the --raw option.

       o   --skip-auto-rehash

           Disable automatic rehashing. Synonym for --disable-auto-rehash.

       o   --skip-column-names, -N

           Do not write column names in results.

       o   --skip-line-numbers, -L

           Do not write line numbers for errors. Useful when you want to
           compare result files that include error messages.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.  Forces
           --protocol=socket when specified on the command line without other
           connection properties; on Windows, forces --protocol=pipe.

       o   --ssl

           Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with other flags).
           Disable with --skip-ssl.

       o   --ssl-ca=name

           CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-capath=name

           CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-cert=name

           X509 cert in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-cipher=name

           SSL cipher to use (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-key=name

           X509 key in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-crl=name

           Certificate revocation list (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-crlpath=name

           Certificate revocation list path (check OpenSSL docs, implies
           --ssl).

       o   --ssl-verify-server-cert

           Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against hostname used
           when connecting. This option is disabled by default.

       o   --table, -t

           Display output in table format. This is the default for interactive
           use, but can be used to produce table output in batch mode.

       o   --tee=file_name

           Append a copy of output to the given file. This option works only
           in interactive mode.  the section called "MYSQL COMMANDS",
           discusses tee files further.

       o   --unbuffered, -n

           Flush the buffer after each query.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

           Verbose mode. Produce more output about what the program does. This
           option can be given multiple times to produce more and more output.
           (For example, -v -v -v produces table output format even in batch
           mode.)

       o   --version, -V

           Display version information and exit.

       o   --vertical, -E

           Print query output rows vertically (one line per column value).
           Without this option, you can specify vertical output for individual
           statements by terminating them with \G.

       o   --wait, -w

           If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead of
           aborting.

       o   --xml, -X

           Produce XML output.  The output when --xml is used with mysql
           matches that of mysqldump --xml. See mysqldump(1) for details.

           The XML output also uses an XML namespace, as shown here:

               shell> mysql --xml -uroot -e "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'"
               <?xml version="1.0"?>
               <resultset statement="SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version</field>
               <field name="Value">5.0.40-debug</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_comment</field>
               <field name="Value">Source distribution</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_compile_machine</field>
               <field name="Value">i686</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_compile_os</field>
               <field name="Value">suse-linux-gnu</field>
               </row>
               </resultset>

           You can also set the following variables by using --var_name=value.

           o   connect_timeout

               The number of seconds before connection timeout. (Default value
               is 0.)

           o   max_allowed_packet

               The maximum packet length to send to or receive from the
               server. (Default value is 16MB.)

           o   max_join_size

               The automatic limit for rows in a join when using
               --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000,000.)

           o   net_buffer_length

               The buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. (Default
               value is 16KB.)

           o   select_limit

               The automatic limit for SELECT statements when using
               --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000.)

           On Unix, the mysql client writes a record of executed statements to
           a history file. By default, this file is named .mysql_history and
           is created in your home directory. To specify a different file, set
           the value of the MYSQL_HISTFILE environment variable.

           The .mysql_history should be protected with a restrictive access
           mode because sensitive information might be written to it, such as
           the text of SQL statements that contain passwords.

           If you do not want to maintain a history file, first remove
           .mysql_history if it exists, and then use either of the following
           techniques:

           o   Set the MYSQL_HISTFILE variable to /dev/null. To cause this
               setting to take effect each time you log in, put the setting in
               one of your shell's startup files.

           o   Create .mysql_history as a symbolic link to /dev/null:

                   shell> ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history

               You need do this only once.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
COMMAND INPUT:
mysql --version 2>/dev/null

COMMAND OUTPUT:

COMMAND: psql

DESCRIPTION: psql - PostgreSQL interactive terminal

USAGE: psql [option...] [dbname [username]]

OPTIONS:
-a
       --echo-all
           Print all nonempty input lines to standard output as they are read.
           (This does not apply to lines read interactively.) This is
           equivalent to setting the variable ECHO to all.

       -A
       --no-align
           Switches to unaligned output mode. (The default output mode is
           aligned.) This is equivalent to \pset format unaligned.

       -b
       --echo-errors
           Print failed SQL commands to standard error output. This is
           equivalent to setting the variable ECHO to errors.

       -c command
       --command=command
           Specifies that psql is to execute the given command string,
           command. This option can be repeated and combined in any order with
           the -f option. When either -c or -f is specified, psql does not
           read commands from standard input; instead it terminates after
           processing all the -c and -f options in sequence.

           command must be either a command string that is completely parsable
           by the server (i.e., it contains no psql-specific features), or a
           single backslash command. Thus you cannot mix SQL and psql
           meta-commands within a -c option. To achieve that, you could use
           repeated -c options or pipe the string into psql, for example:

               psql -c '\x' -c 'SELECT * FROM foo;'

           or

               echo '\x \\ SELECT * FROM foo;' | psql

           (\\ is the separator meta-command.)

           Each SQL command string passed to -c is sent to the server as a
           single request. Because of this, the server executes it as a single
           transaction even if the string contains multiple SQL commands,
           unless there are explicit BEGIN/COMMIT commands included in the
           string to divide it into multiple transactions. (See
           Section 55.2.2.1 for more details about how the server handles
           multi-query strings.)

           If having several commands executed in one transaction is not
           desired, use repeated -c commands or feed multiple commands to
           psql's standard input, either using echo as illustrated above, or
           via a shell here-document, for example:

               psql <<EOF
               \x
               SELECT * FROM foo;
               EOF

       --csv
           Switches to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) output mode. This is
           equivalent to \pset format csv.

       -d dbname
       --dbname=dbname
           Specifies the name of the database to connect to. This is
           equivalent to specifying dbname as the first non-option argument on
           the command line. The dbname can be a connection string. If so,
           connection string parameters will override any conflicting command
           line options.

       -e
       --echo-queries
           Copy all SQL commands sent to the server to standard output as
           well. This is equivalent to setting the variable ECHO to queries.

       -E
       --echo-hidden
           Echo the actual queries generated by \d and other backslash
           commands. You can use this to study psql's internal operations.
           This is equivalent to setting the variable ECHO_HIDDEN to on.

       -f filename
       --file=filename
           Read commands from the file filename, rather than standard input.
           This option can be repeated and combined in any order with the -c
           option. When either -c or -f is specified, psql does not read
           commands from standard input; instead it terminates after
           processing all the -c and -f options in sequence. Except for that,
           this option is largely equivalent to the meta-command \i.

           If filename is - (hyphen), then standard input is read until an EOF
           indication or \q meta-command. This can be used to intersperse
           interactive input with input from files. Note however that Readline
           is not used in this case (much as if -n had been specified).

           Using this option is subtly different from writing psql < filename.
           In general, both will do what you expect, but using -f enables some
           nice features such as error messages with line numbers. There is
           also a slight chance that using this option will reduce the
           start-up overhead. On the other hand, the variant using the shell's
           input redirection is (in theory) guaranteed to yield exactly the
           same output you would have received had you entered everything by
           hand.

       -F separator
       --field-separator=separator
           Use separator as the field separator for unaligned output. This is
           equivalent to \pset fieldsep or \f.

       -h hostname
       --host=hostname
           Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is
           running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the
           directory for the Unix-domain socket.

       -H
       --html
           Switches to HTML output mode. This is equivalent to \pset format
           html or the \H command.

       -l
       --list
           List all available databases, then exit. Other non-connection
           options are ignored. This is similar to the meta-command \list.

           When this option is used, psql will connect to the database
           postgres, unless a different database is named on the command line
           (option -d or non-option argument, possibly via a service entry,
           but not via an environment variable).

       -L filename
       --log-file=filename
           Write all query output into file filename, in addition to the
           normal output destination.

       -n
       --no-readline
           Do not use Readline for line editing and do not use the command
           history (see the section called "Command-Line Editing" below).

       -o filename
       --output=filename
           Put all query output into file filename. This is equivalent to the
           command \o.

       -p port
       --port=port
           Specifies the TCP port or the local Unix-domain socket file
           extension on which the server is listening for connections.
           Defaults to the value of the PGPORT environment variable or, if not
           set, to the port specified at compile time, usually 5432.

       -P assignment
       --pset=assignment
           Specifies printing options, in the style of \pset. Note that here
           you have to separate name and value with an equal sign instead of a
           space. For example, to set the output format to LaTeX, you could
           write -P format=latex.

       -q
       --quiet
           Specifies that psql should do its work quietly. By default, it
           prints welcome messages and various informational output. If this
           option is used, none of this happens. This is useful with the -c
           option. This is equivalent to setting the variable QUIET to on.

       -R separator
       --record-separator=separator
           Use separator as the record separator for unaligned output. This is
           equivalent to \pset recordsep.

       -s
       --single-step
           Run in single-step mode. That means the user is prompted before
           each command is sent to the server, with the option to cancel
           execution as well. Use this to debug scripts.

       -S
       --single-line
           Runs in single-line mode where a newline terminates an SQL command,
           as a semicolon does.

               Note
               This mode is provided for those who insist on it, but you are
               not necessarily encouraged to use it. In particular, if you mix
               SQL and meta-commands on a line the order of execution might
               not always be clear to the inexperienced user.

       -t
       --tuples-only
           Turn off printing of column names and result row count footers,
           etc. This is equivalent to \t or \pset tuples_only.

       -T table_options
       --table-attr=table_options
           Specifies options to be placed within the HTML table tag. See \pset
           tableattr for details.

       -U username
       --username=username
           Connect to the database as the user username instead of the
           default. (You must have permission to do so, of course.)

       -v assignment
       --set=assignment
       --variable=assignment
           Perform a variable assignment, like the \set meta-command. Note
           that you must separate name and value, if any, by an equal sign on
           the command line. To unset a variable, leave off the equal sign. To
           set a variable with an empty value, use the equal sign but leave
           off the value. These assignments are done during command line
           processing, so variables that reflect connection state will get
           overwritten later.

       -V
       --version
           Print the psql version and exit.

       -w
       --no-password
           Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password
           authentication and a password is not available from other sources
           such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This
           option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is
           present to enter a password.

           Note that this option will remain set for the entire session, and
           so it affects uses of the meta-command \connect as well as the
           initial connection attempt.

       -W
       --password
           Force psql to prompt for a password before connecting to a
           database, even if the password will not be used.

           If the server requires password authentication and a password is
           not available from other sources such as a .pgpass file, psql will
           prompt for a password in any case. However, psql will waste a
           connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In
           some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the extra connection
           attempt.

           Note that this option will remain set for the entire session, and
           so it affects uses of the meta-command \connect as well as the
           initial connection attempt.

       -x
       --expanded
           Turn on the expanded table formatting mode. This is equivalent to
           \x or \pset expanded.

       -X
       --no-psqlrc
           Do not read the start-up file (neither the system-wide psqlrc file
           nor the user's ~/.psqlrc file).

       -z
       --field-separator-zero
           Set the field separator for unaligned output to a zero byte. This
           is equivalent to \pset fieldsep_zero.

       -0
       --record-separator-zero
           Set the record separator for unaligned output to a zero byte. This
           is useful for interfacing, for example, with xargs -0. This is
           equivalent to \pset recordsep_zero.

       -1
       --single-transaction
           This option can only be used in combination with one or more -c
           and/or -f options. It causes psql to issue a BEGIN command before
           the first such option and a COMMIT command after the last one,
           thereby wrapping all the commands into a single transaction. If any
           of the commands fails and the variable ON_ERROR_STOP was set, a
           ROLLBACK command is sent instead. This ensures that either all the
           commands complete successfully, or no changes are applied.

           If the commands themselves contain BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK, this
           option will not have the desired effects. Also, if an individual
           command cannot be executed inside a transaction block, specifying
           this option will cause the whole transaction to fail.

       -?
       --help[=topic]
           Show help about psql and exit. The optional topic parameter
           (defaulting to options) selects which part of psql is explained:
           commands describes psql's backslash commands; options describes the
           command-line options that can be passed to psql; and variables
           shows help about psql configuration variables.

COMMAND: apache2

DESCRIPTION: apache2 - Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol Server

USAGE: apache2 [ -d serverroot ] [ -f config ] [ -C directive ] [ -c directive
       ] [ -D parameter ] [ -e level ] [ -E file ] [  -k  start|restart|grace-
       ful|stop|graceful-stop ] [ -R directory ] [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -L ] [ -S ] [
       -t ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -X ] [ -M ]

OPTIONS:
-d serverroot
              Set  the  initial  value for the ServerRoot directive to server-
              root. This can be overridden by the ServerRoot directive in  the
              configuration file.

       -f config
              Uses  the  directives  in  the file config on startup. If config
              does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path  relative
              to the ServerRoot. The default is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.

       -k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop
              Signals  apache2 to start, restart, or stop. See Stopping Apache
              for more information.

       -C directive
              Process the configuration directive before reading config files.

       -c directive
              Process the configuration directive after reading config files.

       -D parameter
              Sets a configuration parameter which can be used with <IfDefine>
              sections  in  the  configuration  files to conditionally skip or
              process commands at server startup and restart.

       -e level
              Sets the LogLevel to level during server startup. This is useful
              for  temporarily  increasing the verbosity of the error messages
              to find problems during startup.

       -E file
              Send error messages during server startup to file.

       -R directory
              When the server is compiled using  the  SHARED_CORE  rule,  this
              specifies the directory for the shared object files.

       -h     Output a short summary of available command line options.

       -l     Output a list of modules compiled into the server. This will not
              list dynamically loaded modules included  using  the  LoadModule
              directive.

       -L     Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and
              places where the directive is valid.

       -M     Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules.

       -S     Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only
              shows the virtualhost settings).

       -t     Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program imme-
              diately exits after these syntax parsing tests with either a re-
              turn code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax
              Error). If -D DUMP_VHOSTS is also set, details  of  the  virtual
              host  configuration will be printed. If -D DUMP_MODULES  is set,
              all loaded modules will be printed.

       -v     Print the version of apache2, and then exit.

       -V     Print the version and build  parameters  of  apache2,  and  then
              exit.

       -X     Run  apache2  in debug mode. Only one worker will be started and
              the server will not detach from the console.

COMMAND: openssl

DESCRIPTION: openssl - OpenSSL command line program

USAGE: openssl command [ options ... ] [ parameters ... ]

       openssl no-XXX [ options ]

OPTIONS:
Details of which options are available depend on the specific command.
       This section describes some common options with common behavior.

   Common Options
       -help
           Provides a terse summary of all options.  If an option takes an
           argument, the "type" of argument is also given.

       --  This terminates the list of options. It is mostly useful if any
           filename parameters start with a minus sign:

            openssl verify [flags...] -- -cert1.pem...

   Format Options
       See openssl-format-options(1) for manual page.

   Pass Phrase Options
       See the openssl-passphrase-options(1) manual page.

   Random State Options
       Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.1, it was common for applications to store
       information about the state of the random-number generator in a file
       that was loaded at startup and rewritten upon exit. On modern operating
       systems, this is generally no longer necessary as OpenSSL will seed
       itself from a trusted entropy source provided by the operating system.
       These flags are still supported for special platforms or circumstances
       that might require them.

       It is generally an error to use the same seed file more than once and
       every use of -rand should be paired with -writerand.

       -rand files
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ";" for MS-Windows, ","
           for OpenVMS, and ":" for all others. Another way to specify
           multiple files is to repeat this flag with different filenames.

       -writerand file
           Writes the seed data to the specified file upon exit.  This file
           can be used in a subsequent command invocation.

   Certificate Verification Options
       See the openssl-verification-options(1) manual page.

   Name Format Options
       See the openssl-namedisplay-options(1) manual page.

   TLS Version Options
       Several commands use SSL, TLS, or DTLS. By default, the commands use
       TLS and clients will offer the lowest and highest protocol version they
       support, and servers will pick the highest version that the client
       offers that is also supported by the server.

       The options below can be used to limit which protocol versions are
       used, and whether TCP (SSL and TLS) or UDP (DTLS) is used.  Note that
       not all protocols and flags may be available, depending on how OpenSSL
       was built.

       -ssl3, -tls1, -tls1_1, -tls1_2, -tls1_3, -no_ssl3, -no_tls1,
       -no_tls1_1, -no_tls1_2, -no_tls1_3
           These options require or disable the use of the specified SSL or
           TLS protocols.  When a specific TLS version is required, only that
           version will be offered or accepted.  Only one specific protocol
           can be given and it cannot be combined with any of the no_ options.
           The no_* options do not work with s_time and ciphers commands but
           work with s_client and s_server commands.

       -dtls, -dtls1, -dtls1_2
           These options specify to use DTLS instead of TLS.  With -dtls,
           clients will negotiate any supported DTLS protocol version.  Use
           the -dtls1 or -dtls1_2 options to support only DTLS1.0 or DTLS1.2,
           respectively.

   Engine Options
       -engine id
           Load the engine identified by id and use all the methods it
           implements (algorithms, key storage, etc.), unless specified
           otherwise in the command-specific documentation or it is configured
           to do so, as described in "Engine Configuration" in config(5).

           The engine will be used for key ids specified with -key and similar
           options when an option like -keyform engine is given.

           A special case is the "loader_attic" engine, which is meant just
           for internal OpenSSL testing purposes and supports loading keys,
           parameters, certificates, and CRLs from files.  When this engine is
           used, files with such credentials are read via this engine.  Using
           the "file:" schema is optional; a plain file (path) name will do.

       Options specifying keys, like -key and similar, can use the generic
       OpenSSL engine key loading URI scheme "org.openssl.engine:" to retrieve
       private keys and public keys.  The URI syntax is as follows, in
       simplified form:

           org.openssl.engine:{engineid}:{keyid}

       Where "{engineid}" is the identity/name of the engine, and "{keyid}" is
       a key identifier that's acceptable by that engine.  For example, when
       using an engine that interfaces against a PKCS#11 implementation, the
       generic key URI would be something like this (this happens to be an
       example for the PKCS#11 engine that's part of OpenSC):

           -key org.openssl.engine:pkcs11:label_some-private-key

       As a third possibility, for engines and providers that have implemented
       their own OSSL_STORE_LOADER(3), "org.openssl.engine:" should not be
       necessary.  For a PKCS#11 implementation that has implemented such a
       loader, the PKCS#11 URI as defined in RFC 7512 should be possible to
       use directly:

           -key pkcs11:object=some-private-key;pin-value=1234

   Provider Options
       -provider name
           Load and initialize the provider identified by name. The name can
           be also a path to the provider module. In that case the provider
           name will be the specified path and not just the provider module
           name.  Interpretation of relative paths is platform specific. The
           configured "MODULESDIR" path, OPENSSL_MODULES environment variable,
           or the path specified by -provider-path is prepended to relative
           paths.  See provider(7) for a more detailed description.

       -provider-path path
           Specifies the search path that is to be used for looking for
           providers.  Equivalently, the OPENSSL_MODULES environment variable
           may be set.

       -propquery propq
           Specifies the property query clause to be used when fetching
           algorithms from the loaded providers.  See property(7) for a more
           detailed description.

              Systems   configured   for  rsyslog  support  may  also  log  to
              /var/log/ufw.log. Specifying a LEVEL turns logging  on  for  the
              specified  LEVEL.  The  default log level is 'low'.  See LOGGING
              for details.

       reset  Disables and resets firewall to installation defaults. Can  also
              give  the  --force option to perform the reset without confirma-
              tion.

       status show status of firewall and ufw managed rules. Use  status  ver-
              bose  for extra information. In the status output, 'Anywhere' is
              synonymous with 'any', 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) and  ::/0  (IPv6).  Note
              that  when  using  status, there is a subtle difference when re-
              porting interfaces. For example,  if  the  following  rules  are
              added:

                ufw allow in on eth0 from 192.168.0.0/16
                ufw allow out on eth1 to 10.0.0.0/8
                ufw  route  allow  in  on  eth0 out on eth1 to 10.0.0.0/8 from
              192.168.0.0/16
                ufw limit 2222/tcp comment 'SSH port'

              ufw status will output:

                To                         Action      From
                --                         ------      ----
                Anywhere on eth0           ALLOW       192.168.0.0/16
                10.0.0.0/8                 ALLOW OUT   Anywhere on eth1
                10.0.0.0/8 on eth1         ALLOW FWD   192.168.0.0/16 on eth0
                Anywhere                          LIMIT               Anywhere
              # SSH port

              For  the input and output rules, the interface is reported rela-
              tive to the firewall system as an endpoint, whereas  with  route
              rules, the interface is reported relative to the direction pack-
              ets flow through the firewall.

       show REPORT
              display information about the running firewall. See REPORTS

       allow ARGS

COMMAND: openssl

DESCRIPTION: openssl - OpenSSL command line program

USAGE: openssl command [ options ... ] [ parameters ... ]

       openssl no-XXX [ options ]

OPTIONS:
Details of which options are available depend on the specific command.
       This section describes some common options with common behavior.

   Common Options
       -help
           Provides a terse summary of all options.  If an option takes an
           argument, the "type" of argument is also given.

       --  This terminates the list of options. It is mostly useful if any
           filename parameters start with a minus sign:

            openssl verify [flags...] -- -cert1.pem...

   Format Options
       See openssl-format-options(1) for manual page.

   Pass Phrase Options
       See the openssl-passphrase-options(1) manual page.

   Random State Options
       Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.1, it was common for applications to store
       information about the state of the random-number generator in a file
       that was loaded at startup and rewritten upon exit. On modern operating
       systems, this is generally no longer necessary as OpenSSL will seed
       itself from a trusted entropy source provided by the operating system.
       These flags are still supported for special platforms or circumstances
       that might require them.

       It is generally an error to use the same seed file more than once and
       every use of -rand should be paired with -writerand.

       -rand files
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ";" for MS-Windows, ","
           for OpenVMS, and ":" for all others. Another way to specify
           multiple files is to repeat this flag with different filenames.

       -writerand file
           Writes the seed data to the specified file upon exit.  This file
           can be used in a subsequent command invocation.

   Certificate Verification Options
       See the openssl-verification-options(1) manual page.

   Name Format Options
       See the openssl-namedisplay-options(1) manual page.

   TLS Version Options
       Several commands use SSL, TLS, or DTLS. By default, the commands use
       TLS and clients will offer the lowest and highest protocol version they
       support, and servers will pick the highest version that the client
       offers that is also supported by the server.

       The options below can be used to limit which protocol versions are
       used, and whether TCP (SSL and TLS) or UDP (DTLS) is used.  Note that
       not all protocols and flags may be available, depending on how OpenSSL
       was built.

       -ssl3, -tls1, -tls1_1, -tls1_2, -tls1_3, -no_ssl3, -no_tls1,
       -no_tls1_1, -no_tls1_2, -no_tls1_3
           These options require or disable the use of the specified SSL or
           TLS protocols.  When a specific TLS version is required, only that
           version will be offered or accepted.  Only one specific protocol
           can be given and it cannot be combined with any of the no_ options.
           The no_* options do not work with s_time and ciphers commands but
           work with s_client and s_server commands.

       -dtls, -dtls1, -dtls1_2
           These options specify to use DTLS instead of TLS.  With -dtls,
           clients will negotiate any supported DTLS protocol version.  Use
           the -dtls1 or -dtls1_2 options to support only DTLS1.0 or DTLS1.2,
           respectively.

   Engine Options
       -engine id
           Load the engine identified by id and use all the methods it
           implements (algorithms, key storage, etc.), unless specified
           otherwise in the command-specific documentation or it is configured
           to do so, as described in "Engine Configuration" in config(5).

           The engine will be used for key ids specified with -key and similar
           options when an option like -keyform engine is given.

           A special case is the "loader_attic" engine, which is meant just
           for internal OpenSSL testing purposes and supports loading keys,
           parameters, certificates, and CRLs from files.  When this engine is
           used, files with such credentials are read via this engine.  Using
           the "file:" schema is optional; a plain file (path) name will do.

       Options specifying keys, like -key and similar, can use the generic
       OpenSSL engine key loading URI scheme "org.openssl.engine:" to retrieve
       private keys and public keys.  The URI syntax is as follows, in
       simplified form:

           org.openssl.engine:{engineid}:{keyid}

       Where "{engineid}" is the identity/name of the engine, and "{keyid}" is
       a key identifier that's acceptable by that engine.  For example, when
       using an engine that interfaces against a PKCS#11 implementation, the
       generic key URI would be something like this (this happens to be an
       example for the PKCS#11 engine that's part of OpenSC):

           -key org.openssl.engine:pkcs11:label_some-private-key

       As a third possibility, for engines and providers that have implemented
       their own OSSL_STORE_LOADER(3), "org.openssl.engine:" should not be
       necessary.  For a PKCS#11 implementation that has implemented such a
       loader, the PKCS#11 URI as defined in RFC 7512 should be possible to
       use directly:

           -key pkcs11:object=some-private-key;pin-value=1234

   Provider Options
       -provider name
           Load and initialize the provider identified by name. The name can
           be also a path to the provider module. In that case the provider
           name will be the specified path and not just the provider module
           name.  Interpretation of relative paths is platform specific. The
           configured "MODULESDIR" path, OPENSSL_MODULES environment variable,
           or the path specified by -provider-path is prepended to relative
           paths.  See provider(7) for a more detailed description.

       -provider-path path
           Specifies the search path that is to be used for looking for
           providers.  Equivalently, the OPENSSL_MODULES environment variable
           may be set.

       -propquery propq
           Specifies the property query clause to be used when fetching
           algorithms from the loaded providers.  See property(7) for a more
           detailed description.

COMMAND: lscpu

DESCRIPTION: lscpu - display information about the CPU architecture

USAGE: lscpu [options]

OPTIONS:
-a, --all
           Include lines for online and offline CPUs in the output (default
           for -e). This option may only be specified together with option -e
           or -p.

       -B, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit
           prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are
           exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability, by
           exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1
           MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting
           on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.

       -b, --online
           Limit the output to online CPUs (default for -p). This option may
           only be specified together with option -e or -p.

       -C, --caches[=list]
           Display details about CPU caches. For details about available
           information see --help output.

           If the list argument is omitted, all columns for which data is
           available are included in the command output.

           When specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal sign
           (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
           Examples: -C=NAME,ONE-SIZE or --caches=NAME,ONE-SIZE.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lscpu -C=+ALLOC-POLICY).

       -c, --offline
           Limit the output to offline CPUs. This option may only be specified
           together with option -e or -p.

       -e, --extended[=list]
           Display the CPU information in human-readable format.

           If the list argument is omitted, the default columns are included
           in the command output. The default output is subject to change.

           When specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal sign
           (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
           Examples: '-e=cpu,node' or '--extended=cpu,node'.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lscpu -e=+MHZ).

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format for the default summary or extended output
           (see --extended).

       -p, --parse[=list]
           Optimize the command output for easy parsing.

           If the list argument is omitted, the command output is compatible
           with earlier versions of lscpu. In this compatible format, two
           commas are used to separate CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches are
           identified the cache column is omitted. If the list argument is
           used, cache columns are separated with a colon (:).

           When specifying the list argument, the string of option, equal sign
           (=), and list must not contain any blanks or other whitespace.
           Examples: '-p=cpu,node' or '--parse=cpu,node'.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lscpu -p=+MHZ).

       -s, --sysroot directory
           Gather CPU data for a Linux instance other than the instance from
           which the lscpu command is issued. The specified directory is the
           system root of the Linux instance to be inspected.

       -x, --hex
           Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (for example "ff"). The default
           is to print the sets in list format (for example 0,1). Note that
           before version 2.30 the mask has been printed with 0x prefix.

       -y, --physical
           Display physical IDs for all columns with topology elements (core,
           socket, etc.). Other than logical IDs, which are assigned by lscpu,
           physical IDs are platform-specific values that are provided by the
           kernel. Physical IDs are not necessarily unique and they might not
           be arranged sequentially. If the kernel could not retrieve a
           physical ID for an element lscpu prints the dash (-) character.

           The CPU logical numbers are not affected by this option.

       --output-all
           Output all available columns. This option must be combined with
           either --extended, --parse or --caches.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:

              Each keyword corresponds to a given DMI type and a given  offset
              within  this  entry  type.  Not all strings may be meaningful or
              even defined on all systems. Some keywords may return more  than
              one  result on some systems (e.g.  processor-version on a multi-
              processor system).  If KEYWORD is not provided or not  valid,  a
              list  of  all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode exits with
              an error.  This option cannot be used more than once.

              Note: on Linux, most of these strings can alternatively be  read
              directly   from  sysfs,  typically  from  files  under  /sys/de-
              vices/virtual/dmi/id.  Most of these files are even readable  by
              regular users.

       -t, --type TYPE
              Only  display  the  entries of type TYPE. It can be either a DMI
              type number, or a comma-separated list of  type  numbers,  or  a
              keyword  from  the  following  list:  bios,  system,  baseboard,
              chassis, processor, memory, cache, connector,  slot.   Refer  to
              the DMI TYPES section below for details.  If this option is used
              more than once, the set of displayed entries will be  the  union
              of all the given types.  If TYPE is not provided or not valid, a
              list of all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode  exits  with
              an error.

       -H, --handle HANDLE
              Only display the entry whose handle matches HANDLE.  HANDLE is a
              16-bit integer.

       -u, --dump
              Do not decode the entries, dump their  contents  as  hexadecimal
              instead.   Note that this is still a text output, no binary data
              will be thrown upon you. The strings attached to each entry  are
              displayed  as  both hexadecimal and ASCII. This option is mainly
              useful for debugging.

           --dump-bin FILE
              Do not decode the entries, instead dump the DMI data to  a  file
              in  binary  form.  The  generated  file  is  suitable to pass to
              --from-dump later.

           --from-dump FILE
              Read the DMI data from a binary file previously generated  using
              --dump-bin.

           --no-sysfs
              Do not attempt to read DMI data from sysfs files. This is mainly
              useful for debugging.

           --oem-string N
              Only display the value of the OEM string number N. The first OEM
              string has number 1. With special value count, return the number
              of OEM strings instead.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit

       Options --string, --type, --dump-bin  and  --oem-string  determine  the
       output format and are mutually exclusive.

       Please  note  in  case  of  dmidecode is run on a system with BIOS that
       boasts new SMBIOS specification, which is not  supported  by  the  tool
       yet,  it  will print out relevant message in addition to requested data
       on the very top of the output. Thus informs the output data is not  re-
       liable.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:
COMMAND INPUT:

COMMAND: dmesg

DESCRIPTION: dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

USAGE: dmesg [options]

       dmesg --clear

       dmesg --read-clear [options]

       dmesg --console-level level

       dmesg --console-on

       dmesg --console-off

OPTIONS:
The --clear, --read-clear, --console-on, --console-off, and
       --console-level options are mutually exclusive.

       -C, --clear
           Clear the ring buffer.

       -c, --read-clear
           Clear the ring buffer after first printing its contents.

       -D, --console-off
           Disable the printing of messages to the console.

       -d, --show-delta
           Display the timestamp and the time delta spent between messages. If
           used together with --notime then only the time delta without the
           timestamp is printed.

       -E, --console-on
           Enable printing messages to the console.

       -e, --reltime
           Display the local time and the delta in human-readable format. Be
           aware that conversion to the local time could be inaccurate (see -T
           for more details).

       -F, --file file
           Read the syslog messages from the given file. Note that -F does not
           support messages in kmsg format. The old syslog format is supported
           only.

       -f, --facility list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of facilities.
           For example:

           dmesg --facility=daemon

           will print messages from system daemons only. For all supported
           facilities see the --help output.

       -H, --human
           Enable human-readable output. See also --color, --reltime and
           --nopager.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. The time output format is in "sec.usec"
           format only, log priority level is not decoded by default (use
           --decode to split into facility and priority), the other options to
           control the output format or time format are silently ignored.

       -k, --kernel
           Print kernel messages.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section below.

       -l, --level list
           Restrict output to the given (comma-separated) list of levels. For
           example:

           dmesg --level=err,warn

           will print error and warning messages only. For all supported
           levels see the --help output.

       -n, --console-level level
           Set the level at which printing of messages is done to the console.
           The level is a level number or abbreviation of the level name. For
           all supported levels see the --help output.

           For example, -n 1 or -n emerg prevents all messages, except
           emergency (panic) messages, from appearing on the console. All
           levels of messages are still written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8)
           can still be used to control exactly where kernel messages appear.
           When the -n option is used, dmesg will not print or clear the
           kernel ring buffer.

       --noescape
           The unprintable and potentially unsafe characters (e.g., broken
           multi-byte sequences, terminal controlling chars, etc.) are escaped
           in format \x<hex> for security reason by default. This option
           disables this feature at all. It's usable for example for debugging
           purpose together with --raw. Be careful and don't use it by
           default.

       -P, --nopager
           Do not pipe output into a pager. A pager is enabled by default for
           --human output.

       -p, --force-prefix
           Add facility, level or timestamp information to each line of a
           multi-line message.

       -r, --raw
           Print the raw message buffer, i.e., do not strip the log-level
           prefixes, but all unprintable characters are still escaped (see
           also --noescape).

           Note that the real raw format depends on the method how dmesg reads
           kernel messages. The /dev/kmsg device uses a different format than
           syslog(2). For backward compatibility, dmesg returns data always in
           the syslog(2) format. It is possible to read the real raw data from
           /dev/kmsg by, for example, the command 'dd if=/dev/kmsg
           iflag=nonblock'.

       -S, --syslog
           Force dmesg to use the syslog(2) kernel interface to read kernel
           messages. The default is to use /dev/kmsg rather than syslog(2)
           since kernel 3.5.0.

       -s, --buffer-size size
           Use a buffer of size to query the kernel ring buffer. This is 16392
           by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at
           first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the
           kernel buffer to be larger than the default, then this option can
           be used to view the entire buffer.

       -T, --ctime
           Print human-readable timestamps.

           Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate! The time source
           used for the logs is not updated after system SUSPEND/RESUME.
           Timestamps are adjusted according to current delta between boottime
           and monotonic clocks, this works only for messages printed after
           last resume.

       --since time
           Display record since the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       --until time
           Display record until the specified time. The time is possible to
           specify in absolute way as well as by relative notation (e.g. '1
           hour ago'). Be aware that the timestamp could be inaccurate and see
           --ctime for more details.

       -t, --notime
           Do not print kernel's timestamps.

       --time-format format
           Print timestamps using the given format, which can be ctime,
           reltime, delta or iso. The first three formats are aliases of the
           time-format-specific options. The iso format is a dmesg
           implementation of the ISO-8601 timestamp format. The purpose of
           this format is to make the comparing of timestamps between two
           systems, and any other parsing, easy. The definition of the iso
           timestamp is: YYYY-MM-DD<T>HH:MM:SS,<microseconds><-+><timezone
           offset from UTC>.

           The iso format has the same issue as ctime: the time may be
           inaccurate when a system is suspended and resumed.

       -u, --userspace
           Print userspace messages.

       -w, --follow
           Wait for new messages. This feature is supported only on systems
           with a readable /dev/kmsg (since kernel 3.5.0).

       -W, --follow-new
           Wait and print only new messages.

       -x, --decode
           Decode facility and level (priority) numbers to human-readable
           prefixes.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: grep

DESCRIPTION: grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

USAGE: grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

OPTIONS:
Generic Program Information
       --help Output a usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Output the version number of grep and exit.

   Pattern Syntax
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERNS  as  extended regular expressions (EREs, see
              below).

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular expressions.

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS  as  basic  regular  expressions  (BREs,  see
              below).  This is the default.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret   PATTERNS   as  Perl-compatible  regular  expressions
              (PCREs).  This option is experimental when combined with the  -z
              (--null-data)  option,  and  grep  -P  may warn of unimplemented
              features.

   Matching Control
       -e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS
              Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option is  used  multiple
              times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search for all
              patterns given.  This option can be used to  protect  a  pattern
              beginning with "-".

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used
              multiple times or is combined with  the  -e  (--regexp)  option,
              search  for  all  patterns  given.  The empty file contains zero
              patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and  input  data,  so  that
              characters that differ only in case match each other.

       --no-ignore-case
              Do  not  ignore  case  distinctions  in patterns and input data.
              This is the default.  This option is useful for passing to shell
              scripts  that  already use -i, to cancel its effects because the
              two options override each other.

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       -w, --word-regexp
              Select only those  lines  containing  matches  that  form  whole
              words.   The  test is that the matching substring must either be
              at the  beginning  of  the  line,  or  preceded  by  a  non-word
              constituent  character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end
              of the line or followed by  a  non-word  constituent  character.
              Word-constituent   characters   are  letters,  digits,  and  the
              underscore.  This option has no effect if -x is also specified.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly  match  the  whole  line.
              For  a  regular  expression pattern, this is like parenthesizing
              the pattern and then surrounding it with ^ and $.

   General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching  lines
              for  each  input  file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see
              above), count non-matching lines.

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Surround  the  matched  (non-empty)  strings,  matching   lines,
              context  lines,  file  names,  line  numbers,  byte offsets, and
              separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with  escape
              sequences  to display them in color on the terminal.  The colors
              are defined by the environment variable  GREP_COLORS.   WHEN  is
              never, always, or auto.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Suppress  normal  output;  instead  print the name of each input
              file from which no output would normally have been printed.

       -l, --files-with-matches
              Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input
              file  from  which  output  would  normally  have  been  printed.
              Scanning each input file stops upon first match.

       -m NUM, --max-count=NUM
              Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If NUM  is  zero,
              grep  stops  right  away  without reading input.  A NUM of -1 is
              treated as infinity and grep does not stop; this is the default.
              If  the  input  is  standard  input from a regular file, and NUM
              matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard  input
              is  positioned  to  just  after  the  last  matching line before
              exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing  context  lines.
              This  enables  a  calling process to resume a search.  When grep
              stops after NUM matching lines, it outputs any trailing  context
              lines.   When  the  -c or --count option is also used, grep does
              not  output  a  count  greater  than  NUM.   When  the   -v   or
              --invert-match  option is also used, grep stops after outputting
              NUM non-matching lines.

       -o, --only-matching
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts  of  a  matching  line,
              with each such part on a separate output line.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Quiet;   do   not  write  anything  to  standard  output.   Exit
              immediately with zero status if any match is found, even  if  an
              error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.

       -s, --no-messages
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.

   Output Line Prefix Control
       -b, --byte-offset
              Print  the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each
              line of output.  If -o (--only-matching) is specified, print the
              offset of the matching part itself.

       -H, --with-filename
              Print  the  file  name for each match.  This is the default when
              there is more than one file to search.  This is a GNU extension.

       -h, --no-filename
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on  output.   This  is  the
              default  when there is only one file (or only standard input) to
              search.

       --label=LABEL
              Display input actually  coming  from  standard  input  as  input
              coming  from  file  LABEL.  This can be useful for commands that
              transform a file's contents before  searching,  e.g.,  gzip  -cd
              foo.gz  |  grep  --label=foo -H 'some pattern'.  See also the -H
              option.

       -n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line  number  within
              its input file.

       -T, --initial-tab
              Make  sure  that the first character of actual line content lies
              on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks normal.  This
              is  useful  with  options that prefix their output to the actual
              content: -H,-n, and -b.  In order  to  improve  the  probability
              that lines from a single file will all start at the same column,
              this also causes the line number and byte offset (if present) to
              be printed in a minimum size field width.

       -Z, --null
              Output  a  zero  byte  (the  ASCII NUL character) instead of the
              character that normally follows a file name.  For example,  grep
              -lZ  outputs  a  zero  byte  after each file name instead of the
              usual newline.  This option makes the output  unambiguous,  even
              in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like
              newlines.  This option can  be  used  with  commands  like  find
              -print0,  perl  -0,  sort  -z, and xargs -0 to process arbitrary
              file names, even those that contain newline characters.

   Context Line Control
       -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
              Print NUM  lines  of  trailing  context  after  matching  lines.
              Places   a  line  containing  a  group  separator  (--)  between
              contiguous groups of matches.  With the  -o  or  --only-matching
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
              Print  NUM  lines  of  leading  context  before  matching lines.
              Places  a  line  containing  a  group  separator  (--)   between
              contiguous  groups  of  matches.  With the -o or --only-matching
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of output context.  Places a line  containing  a
              group separator (--) between contiguous groups of matches.  With
              the -o or --only-matching option,  this  has  no  effect  and  a
              warning is given.

       --group-separator=SEP
              When  -A,  -B, or -C are in use, print SEP instead of -- between
              groups of lines.

       --no-group-separator
              When -A, -B, or -C are in use, do not print a separator  between
              groups of lines.

   File and Directory Selection
       -a, --text
              Process  a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to
              the --binary-files=text option.

       --binary-files=TYPE
              If a file's data or metadata indicate  that  the  file  contains
              binary  data,  assume  that  the file is of type TYPE.  Non-text
              bytes indicate binary data; these are either output  bytes  that
              are  improperly  encoded  for  the current locale, or null input
              bytes when the -z option is not given.

              By default, TYPE is binary, and  grep  suppresses  output  after
              null  input  binary  data  is  discovered, and suppresses output
              lines that contain improperly encoded data.  When some output is
              suppressed,  grep  follows any output with a message to standard
              error saying that a binary file matches.

              If TYPE is without-match, when grep discovers null input  binary
              data  it  assumes that the rest of the file does not match; this
              is equivalent to the -I option.

              If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary  file  as  if  it  were
              text; this is equivalent to the -a option.

              When  type  is  binary,  grep  may  treat non-text bytes as line
              terminators even without the -z  option.   This  means  choosing
              binary  versus text can affect whether a pattern matches a file.
              For example, when type is binary the pattern q$  might  match  q
              immediately  followed  by  a  null byte, even though this is not
              matched when type is text.  Conversely, when type is binary  the
              pattern . (period) might not match a null byte.

              Warning:  The  -a  option might output binary garbage, which can
              have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and  if  the
              terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.  On the other
              hand, when reading files whose text encodings  are  unknown,  it
              can   be  helpful  to  use  -a  or  to  set  LC_ALL='C'  in  the
              environment, in order to find more matches even if  the  matches
              are unsafe for direct display.

       -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION
              If  an  input  file  is  a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to
              process it.  By  default,  ACTION  is  read,  which  means  that
              devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION
              is skip, devices are silently skipped.

       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
              If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process  it.   By
              default,  ACTION is read, i.e., read directories just as if they
              were  ordinary  files.   If  ACTION  is  skip,   silently   skip
              directories.   If  ACTION  is recurse, read all files under each
              directory, recursively, following symbolic links  only  if  they
              are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the -r option.

       --exclude=GLOB
              Skip  any  command-line file with a name suffix that matches the
              pattern GLOB, using wildcard matching; a name suffix  is  either
              the  whole name, or a trailing part that starts with a non-slash
              character immediately after a  slash  (/)  in  the  name.   When
              searching  recursively, skip any subfile whose base name matches
              GLOB; the base name is the part after the last slash.  A pattern
              can  use *, ?, and [...] as wildcards, and \ to quote a wildcard
              or backslash character literally.

       --exclude-from=FILE
              Skip files whose base name matches any of  the  file-name  globs
              read  from  FILE  (using  wildcard  matching  as described under
              --exclude).

       --exclude-dir=GLOB
              Skip any command-line directory with a name suffix that  matches
              the   pattern   GLOB.   When  searching  recursively,  skip  any
              subdirectory whose base name matches GLOB.  Ignore any redundant
              trailing slashes in GLOB.

       -I     Process  a  binary  file as if it did not contain matching data;
              this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.

       --include=GLOB
              Search only files whose base name matches GLOB  (using  wildcard
              matching   as  described  under  --exclude).   If  contradictory
              --include and --exclude options are given, the last matching one
              wins.   If  no  --include  or --exclude options match, a file is
              included unless the first such option is --include.

       -r, --recursive
              Read all files  under  each  directory,  recursively,  following
              symbolic  links only if they are on the command line.  Note that
              if  no  file  operand  is  given,  grep  searches  the   working
              directory.  This is equivalent to the -d recurse option.

       -R, --dereference-recursive
              Read  all  files  under each directory, recursively.  Follow all
              symbolic links, unlike -r.

   Other Options
       --line-buffered
              Use line buffering on output.   This  can  cause  a  performance
              penalty.

       -U, --binary
              Treat  the  file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-
              Windows, grep guesses whether  a  file  is  text  or  binary  as
              described  for  the  --binary-files option.  If grep decides the
              file is a text file,  it  strips  the  CR  characters  from  the
              original file contents (to make regular expressions with ^ and $
              work  correctly).   Specifying  -U  overrules  this   guesswork,
              causing  all  files  to  be  read  and  passed  to  the matching
              mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF  pairs
              at   the  end  of  each  line,  this  will  cause  some  regular
              expressions to fail.  This option has  no  effect  on  platforms
              other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       -z, --null-data
              Treat  input  and  output  data  as  sequences  of  lines,  each
              terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a
              newline.   Like the -Z or --null option, this option can be used
              with commands like sort -z to process arbitrary file names.

COMMAND: env

DESCRIPTION: env - run a program in a modified environment

USAGE: env [OPTION]... [-] [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARG]...]

OPTIONS:
-S/--split-string usage in scripts
       The  -S option allows specifying multiple parameters in a script.  Run-
       ning a script named 1.pl containing the following first line:

              #!/usr/bin/env -S perl -w -T
              ...

       Will execute perl -w -T 1.pl .

       Without the '-S' parameter the script will likely fail with:

              /usr/bin/env: 'perl -w -T': No such file or directory

       See the full documentation for more details.

   --default-signal[=SIG] usage
       This option allows setting a signal  handler  to  its  default  action,
       which  is  not  possible using the traditional shell trap command.  The
       following example ensures that seq will be  terminated  by  SIGPIPE  no
       matter  how  this  signal  is being handled in the process invoking the
       command.

              sh -c 'env --default-signal=PIPE seq inf | head -n1'

COMMAND: curl

DESCRIPTION: curl - transfer a URL

USAGE: curl [options / URLs]

OPTIONS:
Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the  options  require  an
       additional value next to them.

       The  short  "single-dash"  form  of the options, -d for example, may be
       used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space
       is a recommended separator. The long "double-dash" form, -d, --data for
       example, requires a space between it and its value.

       Short version options that do not need any  additional  values  can  be
       used  immediately  next to each other, like for example you can specify
       all the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
       disabled  with  --no-option.  That is, you use the same option name but
       prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we  mostly  only  list  and
       show the --option version of them.

       --abstract-unix-socket <path>
              (HTTP)  Connect  through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead
              of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path  of  an  ab-
              stract  socket  prefixed  with  '@', however the <path> argument
              should not have this leading character.

              If --abstract-unix-socket is provided several  times,  the  last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com

              See also --unix-socket. Added in 7.53.0.

       --alt-svc <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the
              file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be
              used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the
              file name again if it has been modified.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
              make curl just handle the cache in memory.

              If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents
              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

              --alt-svc can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com

              See also --resolve and --connect-to. Added in 7.64.1.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
              and  use  the most secure one the remote site claims to support.
              This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
              headers,  thus  possibly  inducing  an extra network round-trip.
              This is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific  authentication
              method,  which  you  can  do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and
              --negotiate.

              Using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
              since  it  may require data to be sent twice and then the client
              must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when  uploading
              from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

              Used together with -u, --user.

              Providing --anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com

              See also --proxy-anyauth, --basic and --digest.

       -a, --append
              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the
              target file instead of overwriting it. If the remote  file  does
              not exist, it will be created. Note that this flag is ignored by
              some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

              Providing -a, --append multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-append.

              Example:
               curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/

              See also -r, --range and -C, --continue-at.

       --aws-sigv4 <provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]>
              Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.

              The  provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm
              when creating outgoing authentication headers.

              The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area
              of  a resources collection (region-code) when the region name is
              omitted from the endpoint.

              The service argument is a string that points to a function  pro-
              vided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted
              from the endpoint.

              If --aws-sigv4 is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --aws-sigv4 "aws:amz:east-2:es" --user "key:secret" https://example.com

              See also --basic and -u, --user. Added in 7.75.0.

       --basic
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the re-
              mote host. This is the default and this option is usually point-
              less, unless you use it to override a previously set option that
              sets a different authentication method (such  as  --ntlm,  --di-
              gest, or --negotiate).

              Used together with -u, --user.

              Providing --basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com

              See also --proxy-basic.

       --cacert <file>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
              the peer. The file may contain  multiple  CA  certificates.  The
              certificate(s)  must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to
              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
              alter that default file.

              curl  recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
              if it is set, and uses the given path as a path  to  a  CA  cert
              bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The  windows  version  of  curl will automatically look for a CA
              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
              folder along your PATH.

              If curl is built against  the  NSS  SSL  library,  the  NSS  PEM
              PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this op-
              tion to work properly.

              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure  Transport,
              then  this  option  is supported for backward compatibility with
              other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If  the  option  is
              not  set,  then curl will use the certificates in the system and
              user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred  method
              of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

              (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows
              7 or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is  supported
              for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is
              recommended to use Windows' store of root certificates (the  de-
              fault for Schannel).

              If  --cacert  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --cacert CA-file.txt https://example.com

              See also --capath and -k, --insecure.

       --capath <dir>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to
              verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating
              them with ":" (e.g.  "path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must
              be  in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the di-
              rectory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility sup-
              plied  with  OpenSSL.  Using  --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered
              curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using
              --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored.

              If  --capath  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --capath /local/directory https://example.com

              See also --cacert and -k, --insecure.

       --cert-status
              (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server  certificate
              by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
              extension.

              If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid  (e.g.
              expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-
              tificate has been revoked, or no response at  all  is  received,
              the verification fails.

              This  is  currently  only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and
              NSS backends.

              Providing --cert-status multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-cert-status.

              Example:
               curl --cert-status https://example.com

              See also --pinnedpubkey. Added in 7.41.0.

       --cert-type <type>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  what type the provided client certificate is
              using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.

              The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually  PEM,
              however  for  Secure  Transport  and  Schannel it is P12. If -E,
              --cert is a pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default type.

              If --cert-type is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --cert-type PEM --cert file https://example.com

              See also -E, --cert, --key and --key-type.

       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use the specified client certificate file
              when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-
              col.  The  certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure
              Transport, or PEM format if using any other engine. If  the  op-
              tional  password is not specified, it will be queried for on the
              terminal. Note that this option assumes a certificate file  that
              is  the private key and the client certificate concatenated. See
              -E, --cert and --key to specify them independently.

              In the <certificate> portion of the argument,  you  must  escape
              the  character  ":"  as "\:" so that it is not recognized as the
              password delimiter. Similarly, you must escape the character "\"
              as "\\" so that it is not recognized as an escape character.

              If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
              can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the
              NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
              default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded.

              If  you  provide  a  path relative to the current directory, you
              must prefix the path with "./" in order to avoid confusion  with
              an NSS database nickname.

              If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
              ify  a  certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
              ning with "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
              "pkcs11" if none was provided and the --cert-type option will be
              set as "ENG" if none was provided.

              (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
              then the certificate string can either be the name of a certifi-
              cate/private  key in the system or user keychain, or the path to
              a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If  you  want  to
              use  a  file  from the current directory, please precede it with
              "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

              (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a  path
              expression  to  a  certificate  store.  (Loading PFX is not sup-
              ported; you can import it to a store first). You can use "<store
              location>\<store  name>\<thumbprint>"  to refer to a certificate
              in  the  system  certificates  store,  for   example,   "Curren-
              tUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a".   Thumbprint
              is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see  in  certificate
              details.  Following  store locations are supported: CurrentUser,
              LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,  CurrentUserGroupPolicy,
              LocalMachineGroupPolicy, LocalMachineEnterprise.

              If -E, --cert is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com

              See also --cert-type, --key and --key-type.

       --ciphers <list of ciphers>
              (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
              of  ciphers  must  specify  valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher
              list details on this URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              If --ciphers is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3.

       --compressed-ssh
              (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a request,
              not an order; the server may or may not do it.

              Providing --compressed-ssh multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-compressed-ssh.

              Example:
               curl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/

              See also --compressed. Added in 7.56.0.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
              curl supports, and automatically decompress the content. Headers
              are not modified.

              If  this  option is used and the server sends an unsupported en-
              coding, curl will report an error. This is a request, not an or-
              der; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.

              Providing --compressed multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-compressed.

              Example:
               curl --compressed https://example.com

              See also --compressed-ssh.

       -K, --config <file>
              Specify a text file to read curl  arguments  from.  The  command
              line  arguments  found  in the text file will be used as if they
              were provided on the command line.

              Options and their parameters must be specified on the same  line
              in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
              Long option names can optionally be given  in  the  config  file
              without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals
              characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified
              with  one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals charac-
              ter between the option and its parameter.

              If the parameter contains whitespace (or starts with  :  or  =),
              the  parameter  must  be  enclosed  within quotes. Within double
              quotes, the following escape sequences are  available:  \\,  \",
              \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ig-
              nored.

              If the first column of a config line is  a  '#'  character,  the
              rest of the line will be treated as a comment.

              Only write one option per physical line in the config file.

              Specify  the  filename  to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read
              the file from stdin.

              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you
              need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply
              writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to
              this:

              url = "https://curl.se/docs/"

               # --- Example file ---
               # this is a comment
               url = "example.com"
               output = "curlhere.html"
               user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

               # and fetch another URL too
               url = "example.com/docs/manpage.html"
               -O
               referer = "http://nowhereatall.example.com/"
               # --- End of example file ---

              When  curl  is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks
              for a default config file and uses it if found,  even  when  -K,
              --config  is used. The default config file is checked for in the
              following places in this order:

              1) "$CURL_HOME/.curlrc"

              2) "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.curlrc" (Added in 7.73.0)

              3) "$HOME/.curlrc"

              4) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\.curlrc"

              5) Windows: "%APPDATA%\.curlrc"

              6) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\.curlrc"

              7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory

              8) On Windows, if it finds no .curlrc file in the  sequence  de-
              scribed  above,  it checks for one in the same dir the curl exe-
              cutable is placed.

              On Windows two filenames are checked per location:  .curlrc  and
              _curlrc,  preferring  the  former.  Older  versions  on  Windows
              checked for _curlrc only.

              -K, --config can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --config file.txt https://example.com

              See also -q, --disable.

       --connect-timeout <fractional seconds>
              Maximum time in seconds that  you  allow  curl's  connection  to
              take.   This  only  limits the connection phase, so if curl con-
              nects within the given period it will continue - if not it  will
              exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.

              The "connection phase" is considered complete when the requested
              TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If --connect-timeout is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com
               curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com

              See also -m, --max-time.

       --connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>

              For  a  request  to  the  given  HOST1:PORT1  pair,  connect  to
              HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct requests
              at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a clus-
              ter of servers. This option is only used to establish  the  net-
              work  connection.  It  does NOT affect the hostname/port that is
              used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the
              application  protocols.  "HOST1"  and  "PORT1"  may be the empty
              string, meaning "any host/port". "HOST2" and "PORT2" may also be
              the   empty   string,   meaning   "use  the  request's  original
              host/port".

              A "host" specified to this option is compared as a string, so it
              needs  to  match  the name used in request URL. It can be either
              numerical such as "127.0.0.1" or the full host name such as "ex-
              ample.org".

              --connect-to can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com

              See also --resolve and -H, --header. Added in 7.49.0.

       -C, --continue-at <offset>
              Continue/Resume  a  previous  file transfer at the given offset.
              The given offset is the exact  number  of  bytes  that  will  be
              skipped,  counting  from the beginning of the source file before
              it is transferred to the destination. If used with uploads,  the
              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

              Use  "-C  -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to
              resume the transfer. It then uses the given  output/input  files
              to figure that out.

              If  -C,  --continue-at  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -C - https://example.com
               curl -C 400 https://example.com

              See also -r, --range.

       -c, --cookie-jar <filename>
              (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all  cookies
              after  a  completed  operation. Curl writes all cookies from its
              in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of  opera-
              tions.  If  no  cookies  are known, no data will be written. The
              file will be written using the Netscape cookie file  format.  If
              you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the cookies will be
              written to stdout.

              This command line option will activate the  cookie  engine  that
              makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is
              to use the -b, --cookie option.

              If the cookie jar cannot be created or  written  to,  the  whole
              curl  operation  will  not fail or even report an error clearly.
              Using -v, --verbose will get a warning displayed,  but  that  is
              the  only  visible  feedback  you get about this possibly lethal
              situation.

              If -c, --cookie-jar is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com
               curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com

              See also -b, --cookie.

       -b, --cookie <data|filename>
              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It
              is supposedly the data previously received from the server in  a
              "Set-Cookie:"   line.   The   data   should  be  in  the  format
              "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2". This makes  curl  use  the  cookie
              header  with this content explicitly in all outgoing request(s).
              If multiple requests are done due  to  authentication,  followed
              redirects or similar, they will all get this cookie passed on.

              If  no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated
              as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
              also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record in-
              coming cookies, which may be handy if you are using this in com-
              bination  with  the  -L,  --location  option  or do multiple URL
              transfers on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a  mi-
              nus ("-"), curl will instead read the contents from stdin.

              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
              HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the  Netscape/Mozilla  cookie
              file format.

              The  file  specified with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No
              cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies,  use  the
              -c, --cookie-jar option.

              If  you  use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a do-
              main then the cookie is not sent since  the  domain  will  never
              match.  To  address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing
              that will include sub-domains) or preferably: use  the  Netscape
              format.

              Users  often want to both read cookies from a file and write up-
              dated cookies back to a file, so using both -b, --cookie and -c,
              --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.

              -b, --cookie can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -b cookiefile https://example.com
               curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com

              See also -c, --cookie-jar and -j, --junk-session-cookies.

       --create-dirs
              When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will
              create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This
              option  creates  the directories mentioned with the -o, --output
              option, nothing else. If the -o, --output file name uses no  di-
              rectory, or if the directories it mentions already exist, no di-
              rectories will be created.

              Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.

              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try  --ftp-
              create-dirs.

              Providing  --create-dirs  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-create-dirs.

              Example:
               curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com

              See also --ftp-create-dirs and --output-dir.

       --create-file-mode <mode>
              (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using
              one  of  the supported protocols, this option allows the user to
              set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation time, instead of
              the default 0644.

              This option takes an octal number as argument.

              If  --create-file-mode  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new

              See also --ftp-create-dirs. Added in 7.75.0.

       --crlf (FTP SMTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in  upload.  Useful  for  MVS
              (OS/390).

              (SMTP added in 7.40.0)

              Providing --crlf multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it
              again with --no-crlf.

              Example:
               curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/

              See also -B, --use-ascii.

       --crlfile <file>
              (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revoca-
              tion List that may specify peer certificates that are to be con-
              sidered revoked.

              If --crlfile is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com

              See also --cacert and --capath.

       --curves <algorithm list>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to request specific curves to use during SSL
              session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.  Multiple  al-
              gorithms  can  be  provided  by  separating  them with ":" (e.g.
              "X25519:P-521").  The parameter is available identically in  the
              "openssl s_client/s_server" utilities.

              --curves  allows  a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL-connections
              with exactly the (EC) curve requested by  the  client,  avoiding
              nontransparent client/server negotiations.

              If  this  option  is  set,  the  default  curves list built into
              openssl will be ignored.

              If --curves is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --curves X25519 https://example.com

              See also --ciphers. Added in 7.73.0.

       --data-ascii <data>
              (HTTP) This is just an alias for -d, --data.

              --data-ascii can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --data-ascii @file https://example.com

              See also --data-binary, --data-raw and --data-urlencode.

       --data-binary <data>
              (HTTP)  This  posts data exactly as specified with no extra pro-
              cessing whatsoever.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as -d, --data does,
              except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and con-
              versions are never done.

              Like  -d,  --data the default content-type sent to the server is
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the  data  to  be
              treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the con-
              tent-type to octet-stream: -H "Content-Type:  application/octet-
              stream".

              If  this  option  is  used several times, the ones following the
              first will append data as described in -d, --data.

              --data-binary can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --data-binary @filename https://example.com

              See also --data-ascii.

       --data-raw <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data similarly to -d, --data but  without  the
              special interpretation of the @ character.

              --data-raw can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --data-raw "hello" https://example.com
               curl --data-raw "@at@at@" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data. Added in 7.43.0.

       --data-urlencode <data>
              (HTTP)  This posts data, similar to the other -d, --data options
              with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.

              To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin  with  a  name
              followed  by a separator and a content specification. The <data>
              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                     on.  Just be careful so that the content does not contain
                     any = or @ symbols, as that will  then  make  the  syntax
                     match one of the other cases below!

              =content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

              name=content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content part and  pass
                     that  on.  Note that the name part is expected to be URL-
                     encoded already.

              @filename
                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-
                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it
                     on in the POST.

              name@filename
                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-
                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it
                     on in the POST. The name part  gets  an  equal  sign  ap-
                     pended,  resulting  in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
                     that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

       --data-urlencode can be used several times in a command line

       Examples:
        curl --data-urlencode name=val https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode =encodethis https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode name@file https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode @fileonly https://example.com

       See also -d, --data and --data-raw.

       -d, --data <data>
              (HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST  request  to  the
              HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has
              filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This  will
              cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F, --form.

              --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special inter-
              pretation  of  the  @ character. To post data purely binary, you
              should instead use the --data-binary option. To  URL-encode  the
              value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

              If  any of these options is used more than once on the same com-
              mand line, the data pieces specified will be merged with a sepa-
              rating  &-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'
              would    generate    a    post    chunk    that    looks    like
              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl  to  read
              the  data  from  stdin.  Posting data from a file named 'foobar'
              would thus be done with -d, --data @foobar. When -d,  --data  is
              told  to  read  from a file like that, carriage returns and new-
              lines will be stripped out. If you do not want the  @  character
              to have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.

              -d, --data can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -d "name=curl" https://example.com
               curl -d "name=curl" -d "tool=cmdline" https://example.com
               curl -d @filename https://example.com

              See  also  --data-binary,  --data-urlencode and --data-raw. This
              option is mutually exclusive to -F, --form and  -I,  --head  and
              -T, --upload-file.

       --delegation <LEVEL>
              (GSS/kerberos)  Set  LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed
              to delegate when it comes to user credentials.

              none   Do not allow any delegation.

              policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag  is  set
                     in  the  Kerberos  service  ticket,  which is a matter of
                     realm policy.

              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       If --delegation is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
       used.

       Example:
        curl --delegation "none" https://example.com

       See also -k, --insecure and --ssl.

       --digest
              (HTTP)  Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authenti-
              cation scheme that prevents the password from  being  sent  over
              the  wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal
              -u, --user option to set user name and password.

              Providing --digest multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable
              it again with --no-digest.

              Example:
               curl -u name:password --digest https://example.com

              See  also  -u, --user, --proxy-digest and --anyauth. This option
              is mutually exclusive to --basic and --ntlm and --negotiate.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
              attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with  this
              option,  it  will  use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten-
              sions to the original FTP protocol, and  may  not  work  on  all
              servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
              the traditional PORT command.

              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt
              is an alias for --disable-eprt.

              If  the  server is accessed using IPv6, this option will have no
              effect as EPRT is necessary then.

              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
              switch  to  passive  mode  you need to not use -P, --ftp-port or
              force it with --ftp-pasv.

              Providing --disable-eprt multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable-eprt.

              Example:
               curl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-epsv and -P, --ftp-port.

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP)  Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when do-
              ing passive FTP transfers. Curl will normally always  first  at-
              tempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not
              try using EPSV.

              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
              is an alias for --disable-epsv.

              If  the  server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect
              as EPSV is necessary then.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
              switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.

              Providing  --disable-epsv  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable-epsv.

              Example:
               curl --disable-epsv ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-eprt and -P, --ftp-port.

       -q, --disable
              If used as the first parameter on the command line,  the  curlrc
              config  file will not be read and used. See the -K, --config for
              details on the default config file search path.

              Providing -q, --disable multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable.

              Example:
               curl -q https://example.com

              See also -K, --config.

       --disallow-username-in-url
              (HTTP)  This  tells  curl  to  exit if passed a URL containing a
              username. This is probably most useful when  the  URL  is  being
              provided at runtime or similar.

              Providing --disallow-username-in-url multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-disallow-username-in-url.

              Example:
               curl --disallow-username-in-url https://example.com

              See also --proto. Added in 7.61.0.

       --dns-interface <interface>
              (DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS  requests  through  <inter-
              face>.  This  option is a counterpart to --interface (which does
              not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an  interface  name
              (not an address).

              If --dns-interface is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also --dns-ipv4-addr  and  --dns-ipv6-addr.  --dns-interface
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv4-addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv4 DNS re-
              quests,  so  that  the DNS requests originate from this address.
              The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

              If --dns-ipv4-addr is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3 https://example.com

              See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-ipv4-addr
              requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv6-addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv6 DNS re-
              quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
              The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

              If --dns-ipv6-addr is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-ipv6-addr 2a04:4e42::561 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface  and  --dns-ipv4-addr.  --dns-ipv6-addr
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-servers <addresses>
              Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system de-
              fault.   The  list of IP addresses should be separated with com-
              mas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as :<port-number>
              after each IP address.

              If  --dns-servers  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface and --dns-ipv4-addr. --dns-servers  re-
              quires  that the underlying libcurl was built to support c-ares.
              Added in 7.33.0.

       --doh-cert-status
              Same as --cert-status but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

              Providing --doh-cert-status multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-doh-cert-status.

              Example:
               curl --doh-cert-status --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh-insecure
              Same as -k, --insecure but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

              Providing  --doh-insecure  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-doh-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --doh-insecure --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-url. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh-url <URL>
              Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to  use  to  resolve
              hostnames, instead of using the default name resolver mechanism.
              The URL must be HTTPS.

              Some SSL options that you set for your transfer  will  apply  to
              DoH  since  the  name  lookups take place over SSL. However, the
              certificate verification settings are not inherited and  can  be
              controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status.

              This  option  is unset if an empty string "" is used as the URL.
              (Added in 7.85.0)

              If --doh-url is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.62.0.

       -D, --dump-header <filename>
              (HTTP  FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the specified
              file. If no headers are received, the use of  this  option  will
              create an empty file.

              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered
              being "headers" and thus are saved there.

              Having multiple transfers in one set  of  operations  (i.e.  the
              URLs  in  one  -:,  --next clause), will append them to the same
              file, separated by a blank line.

              If -D, --dump-header is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dump-header store.txt https://example.com

              See also -o, --output.

       --egd-file <file>
              (TLS)  Deprecated  option.  This option is ignored by curl since
              7.84.0. Prior to that it only had an effect on curl if built  to
              use old versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify  the  path  name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket.
              The socket is used to seed the random  engine  for  SSL  connec-
              tions.

              If --egd-file is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --egd-file /random/here https://example.com

              See also --random-file.

       --engine <name>
              (TLS) Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher  opera-
              tions. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time supported
              engines. Note that not all (and possibly none)  of  the  engines
              may be available at runtime.

              If  --engine  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --engine flavor https://example.com

              See also --ciphers and --curves.

       --etag-compare <file>
              (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the spe-
              cific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom If-None-
              Match header using the stored ETag.

              For correct results, make sure that the specified file  contains
              only  a  single  line  with  the  desired ETag. An empty file is
              parsed as an empty ETag.

              Use the option --etag-save to first save the  ETag  from  a  re-
              sponse,  and  then  use this option to compare against the saved
              ETag in a subsequent request.

              If --etag-compare is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --etag-compare etag.txt https://example.com

              See also --etag-save and -z, --time-cond. Added in 7.68.0.

       --etag-save <file>
              (HTTP)  This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified file. An
              ETag is a caching related header,  usually  returned  in  a  re-
              sponse.

              If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.

              If  --etag-save  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --etag-save storetag.txt https://example.com

              See also --etag-compare. Added in 7.68.0.

       --expect100-timeout <seconds>
              (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
              100-continue  response  when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue
              header in its request. By default curl  will  wait  one  second.
              This  option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting, it
              will continue as if the response has been received.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If --expect100-timeout is provided several times, the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file https://example.com

              See also --connect-timeout. Added in 7.47.0.

       --fail-early
              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

              When  curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line,
              it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By de-
              fault,  it  will  ignore errors if there are more URLs given and
              the last URL's success will determine the error  code  curl  re-
              turns. So early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent success-
              ful transfers.

              Using this option, curl will instead  return  an  error  on  the
              first  transfer  that  fails,  independent of the amount of URLs
              that are given on the command line. This way, no transfer  fail-
              ures go undetected by scripts and similar.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to
              fail  due  to the server's HTTP status code. You can combine the
              two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is there-
              fore contained by -:, --next.

              Providing --fail-early multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-fail-early.

              Example:
               curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example

              See also -f, --fail and --fail-with-body. Added in 7.52.0.

       --fail-with-body
              (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP  response
              code  is  400  or  greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server
              fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating
              so  (which  often  also  describes why and more). This flag will
              still allow curl to output and save that content but also to re-
              turn error 22.

              This  is  an  alternative  option to -f, --fail which makes curl
              fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.

              Providing --fail-with-body multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.

              Example:
               curl --fail-with-body https://example.com

              See  also  -f,  --fail. This option is mutually exclusive to -f,
              --fail. Added in 7.76.0.

       -f, --fail
              (HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors. This is
              useful  to  enable  scripts and users to better deal with failed
              attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a
              document,  it  returns  an HTML document stating so (which often
              also describes why and more). This flag will prevent  curl  from
              outputting that and return error 22.

              This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
              successful response codes will slip through, especially when au-
              thentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

              Providing  -f,  --fail multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-fail.

              Example:
               curl --fail https://example.com

              See also --fail-with-body. This option is mutually exclusive  to
              --fail-with-body.

       --false-start
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use false start during the TLS handshake.
              False start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending  ap-
              plication  data  before verifying the server's Finished message,
              thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

              This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure  Trans-
              port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.

              Providing  --false-start  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-false-start.

              Example:
               curl --false-start https://example.com

              See also --tcp-fastopen. Added in 7.42.0.

       --form-escape
              (HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields  and
              files using backslash-escaping instead of percent-encoding.

              If  --form-escape  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --form-escape -F 'field\name=curl' -F 'file=@load"this' https://example.com

              See also -F, --form. Added in 7.81.0.

       --form-string <name=string>
              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to -F, --form  except  that  the  value
              string  for  the  named parameter is used literally. Leading '@'
              and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no
              special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there's
              any possibility that the string value may  accidentally  trigger
              the '@' or '<' features of -F, --form.

              --form-string can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --form-string "data" https://example.com

              See also -F, --form.

       -F, --form <name=content>
              (HTTP  SMTP  IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emu-
              late a filled-in form in which a user  has  pressed  the  submit
              button.  This  causes  curl  to POST data using the Content-Type
              multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.

              For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a mul-
              tipart mail message to transmit.

              This  enables  uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'con-
              tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
              just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
              the symbol <. The difference between @ and  <  is  then  that  @
              makes  a  file  get attached in the post as a file upload, while
              the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
              field from a file.

              Tell  curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by using
              - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs. When stdin
              is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to de-
              termine its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a  part's
              data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or sim-
              ilar) is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be  ef-
              fectively  read at transmission time; since the full size is un-
              known before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by
              HTTP and rejected by IMAP.

              Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the
              name of the form-field to which the file  portrait.jpg  will  be
              the input:

               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

              Example:  send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the
              server:

               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/

              Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send  it
              as  a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local
              file:

               curl -F "story=<hugefile.txt" https://example.com/

              You can also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use  by  using
              'type=', in a manner similar to:

               curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" example.com

              or

               curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" example.com

              You  can  also explicitly change the name field of a file upload
              part by setting filename=, like this:

               curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" example.com

              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by  dou-
              ble-quotes like:

               curl -F "file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"" example.com

              or

               curl -F 'file=@"local,file";filename="name;in;post"' example.com

              Note  that  if  a  filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any
              double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
              backslash.

              Quoting  must  also  be  applied to non-file data if it contains
              semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:

               curl -F 'colors="red; green; blue";type=text/x-myapp' example.com

              You can add custom headers to the  field  by  setting  headers=,
              like

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=\"X-submit-type: OK\"" example.com

              or

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=@headerfile" example.com

              The  headers=  keyword may appear more that once and above notes
              about quoting apply. When headers are read from  a  file,  Empty
              lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each
              header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting
              the  continuation  line  with a space; embedded carriage-returns
              and trailing spaces are stripped.   Here  is  an  example  of  a
              header file contents:

                # This file contain two headers.
                X-header-1: this is a header

                # The following header is folded.
                X-header-2: this is
                 another header

              To  support  sending  multipart mail messages, the syntax is ex-
              tended as follows:
              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character  of
              the argument,
              -  if  data  starts with '(', this signals to start a new multi-
              part: it can be followed by a content type specification.
              - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.

              Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email consist-
              ing in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and
              HTML. It attaches a text file:

               curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
                    -F '=plain text message' \
                    -F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \
                    -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com

              Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=.  Available  en-
              codings are binary and 8bit that do nothing else than adding the
              corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, 7bit  that  only
              rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error, quoted-printable
              and base64 that encodes  data  according  to  the  corresponding
              schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.

              Example:  send  multipart mail with a quoted-printable text mes-
              sage and a base64 attached file:

               curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \
                    -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              -F, --form can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --form "name=curl" --form "file=@loadthis" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data, --form-string and --form-escape.  This  op-
              tion  is mutually exclusive to -d, --data and -I, --head and -T,
              --upload-file.

       --ftp-account <data>
              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name
              and  password has been provided, this data is sent off using the
              ACCT command.

              If --ftp-account is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-account "mr.robot" ftp://example.com/

              See also -u, --user.

       --ftp-alternative-to-user <command>
              (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
              send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
              Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
              "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
              the certificate.

              If --ftp-alternative-to-user is provided several times, the last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-alternative-to-user "U53r" ftp://example.com

              See also --ftp-account and -u, --user.

       --ftp-create-dirs
              (FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses  a  path  that
              does not currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of
              curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
              create missing directories.

              Providing  --ftp-create-dirs multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-create-dirs.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file

              See also --create-dirs.

       --ftp-method <method>
              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an
              FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-
              ing alternatives:

              multicwd
                     curl does a single CWD operation for each  path  part  in
                     the  given URL. For deep hierarchies this means many com-
                     mands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be done.  This
                     is the default but the slowest behavior.

              nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR
                     etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-
                     mands. This is the fastest behavior.

              singlecwd
                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
                     operates on the file "normally"  (like  in  the  multicwd
                     case).  This  is  somewhat  more standards compliant than
                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

       If --ftp-method is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
        curl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
        curl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file

       See also -l, --list-only.

       --ftp-pasv
              (FTP)  Use  passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the
              internal default behavior, but using this option can be used  to
              override a previous -P, --ftp-port option.

              Reversing  an enforced passive really is not doable but you must
              then instead enforce the correct -P, --ftp-port again.

              Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
              then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.

              Providing  --ftp-pasv  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ftp-pasv.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-epsv.

       -P, --ftp-port <address>
              (FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener  roles  when  con-
              necting  with  FTP. This option makes curl use active mode. curl
              then tells the server to connect back to the client's  specified
              address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an
              IP address and port for it to connect to.  <address>  should  be
              one of:

              interface
                     e.g.  "eth0"  to specify which interface's IP address you
                     want to use (Unix only)

              IP address
                     e.g. "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address

              host name
                     e.g. "my.host.domain" to specify the machine

              -      make curl pick the same IP address that is  already  used
                     for the control connection

       Disable the use of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the
       EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really
       PORT++.

       You  can  also  append ":[start]-[end]" to the right of the address, to
       tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means  you  specify  a  port
       range,  from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well,
       but do note that it increases the risk of failure since  the  port  may
       not be available.

       If -P, --ftp-port is provided several times, the last set value will be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl -P - ftp:/example.com
        curl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com
        curl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com

       See also --ftp-pasv and --disable-eprt.

       --ftp-pret
              (FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV  (and  EPSV).
              Certain  FTP  servers,  mainly drftpd, require this non-standard
              command for directory listings as well as up  and  downloads  in
              PASV mode.

              Providing  --ftp-pret  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ftp-pret.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/

              See also -P, --ftp-port and --ftp-pasv.

       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in
              its  response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data
              connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it  al-
              ready uses for the control connection.

              Since curl 7.74.0 this option is enabled by default.

              This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead
              of PASV.

              Providing --ftp-skip-pasv-ip multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-skip-pasv-ip ftp://example.com/

              See also --ftp-pasv.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode <active/passive>
              (FTP)  Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the
              shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not
              reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates
              the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode active --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also --ftp-ssl-ccc.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc
              (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
              layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
              munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
              low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-ccc multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also --ssl and --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.

       --ftp-ssl-control
              (FTP)  Require  SSL/TLS  for  the FTP login, clear for transfer.
              Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted  data  transfers
              for  efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server does not sup-
              port SSL/TLS.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-control multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-control.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-control ftp://example.com

              See also --ssl.

       -G, --get
              When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with -d,
              --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in an  HTTP
              GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
              used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.

              If used in combination with -I, --head, the POST data  will  in-
              stead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

              Providing -G, --get multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-get.

              Examples:
               curl --get https://example.com
               curl --get -d "tool=curl" -d "age=old" https://example.com
               curl --get -I -d "tool=curl" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data and -X, --request.

       -g, --globoff
              This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set
              this  option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[]
              without having curl itself interpret them. Note that these  let-
              ters  are  not  normal legal URL contents but they should be en-
              coded according to the URI standard.

              Providing -g, --globoff multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-globoff.

              Example:
               curl -g "https://example.com/{[]}}}}"

              See also -K, --config and -q, --disable.

       --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms <milliseconds>
              Happy  Eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both
              IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for  dual-stack  hosts,  giving  IPv6  a
              head-start  of the specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6
              address cannot be connected to within that time, then a  connec-
              tion  attempt is made to the IPv4 address in parallel. The first
              connection to be established is the one that is used.

              The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy  Eyeballs
              RFC  6555  says  "It  is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be
              paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against  network
              load."  libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome
              currently default to 300 ms.

              If --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms is provided  several  times,  the
              last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms 500 https://example.com

              See also -m, --max-time and --connect-timeout. Added in 7.59.0.

       --haproxy-protocol
              (HTTP)  Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the beginning
              of the connection. This is used by some load balancers  and  re-
              verse proxies to indicate the client's true IP address and port.

              This  option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a
              service that expects this header.

              Providing --haproxy-protocol multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-haproxy-protocol.

              Example:
               curl --haproxy-protocol https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.60.0.

       -I, --head
              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
              command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a
              document.  When  used  on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the
              file size and last modification time only.

              Providing -I, --head multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-head.

              Example:
               curl -I https://example.com

              See also -G, --get, -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

       -H, --header <header/@file>
              (HTTP  IMAP  SMTP)  Extra header to include in information sent.
              When used within an HTTP request, it is added to the regular re-
              quest headers.

              For an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with -F, --form op-
              tions, it is prepended to the resulting  MIME  document,  effec-
              tively including it at the mail global level. It does not affect
              raw uploaded mails (Added in 7.56.0).

              You may specify any number of extra headers. Note  that  if  you
              should  add a custom header that has the same name as one of the
              internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be
              used  instead of the internal one.  This allows you to make even
              trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should  not  re-
              place internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what
              you are doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement
              without  content  on  the  right  side  of  the colon, as in: -H
              "Host:". If you send the custom header with  no-value  then  its
              header  must  be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Cus-
              tom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".

              curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              This  option can take an argument in @filename style, which then
              adds a header for each line in the input  file.  Using  @-  will
              make curl read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.

              Please note that most anti-spam utilities check the presence and
              value of several MIME mail headers: these  are  "From:",  "To:",
              "Date:"  and  "Subject:"  among  others and should be added with
              this option.

              You need --proxy-header to send custom headers intended  for  an
              HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

              Passing  on  a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header when doing an
              HTTP request with a request body, will make curl send  the  data
              using chunked encoding.

              WARNING:  headers  set  with this option will be set in all HTTP
              requests - even after redirects are  followed,  like  when  told
              with  -L,  --location. This can lead to the header being sent to
              other hosts than the original host, so sensitive headers  should
              be used with caution combined with following redirects.

              -H, --header can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" https://example.com
               curl -H "User-Agent: yes-please/2000" https://example.com
               curl -H "Host:" https://example.com
               curl -H @headers.txt https://example.com

              See also -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer.

       -h, --help <category>
              Usage  help.  This  lists all commands of the <category>.  If no
              arg was provided, curl will display the most  important  command
              line  arguments.   If the argument "all" was provided, curl will
              display all options available.  If the argument  "category"  was
              provided, curl will display all categories and their meanings.

              Example:
               curl --help all

              See also -v, --verbose.

       --hostpubmd5 <md5>
              (SFTP  SCP)  Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The
              string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the  remote  host's
              public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless
              the md5sums match.

              If --hostpubmd5 is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/

              See also --hostpubsha256.

       --hostpubsha256 <sha256>
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing a Base64-encoded SHA256 hash
              of the remote host's public key. Curl will refuse the connection
              with the host unless the hashes match.

              This  feature requires libcurl to be built with libssh2 and does
              not work with other SSH backends.

              If --hostpubsha256 is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --hostpubsha256 NDVkMTQxMGQ1ODdmMjQ3MjczYjAyOTY5MmRkMjVmNDQ= sftp://example.com/

              See also --hostpubmd5. Added in 7.80.0.

       --hsts <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option enables HSTS for the transfer. If the file
              name points to an existing HSTS cache file, that will  be  used.
              After  a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file
              name again if it has been modified.

              If curl is told to use HTTP:// for a transfer involving  a  host
              name  that exists in the HSTS cache, it upgrades the transfer to
              use HTTPS. Each HSTS cache entry has an individual life time af-
              ter which the upgrade is no longer performed.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
              make curl just handle HSTS in memory.

              If this option is used several times, curl  will  load  contents
              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

              --hsts can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --hsts cache.txt https://example.com

              See also --proto. Added in 7.74.0.

       --http0.9
              (HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9 response.

              HTTP/0.9  is  a completely headerless response and therefore you
              can also connect with this to non-HTTP servers and still  get  a
              response since curl will simply transparently downgrade - if al-
              lowed.

              Since curl 7.66.0, HTTP/0.9 is disabled by default.

              Providing --http0.9 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-http0.9.

              Example:
               curl --http0.9 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1, --http2 and --http3. Added in 7.64.0.

       -0, --http1.0
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its
              internally preferred HTTP version.

              Providing -0, --http1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http1.0 https://example.com

              See also --http0.9 and --http1.1. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive  to  --http1.1  and --http2 and --http2-prior-knowledge and
              --http3.

       --http1.1
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

              Providing --http1.1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http1.1 https://example.com

              See also -0, --http1.0 and --http0.9. This  option  is  mutually
              exclusive  to -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and --http2-prior-knowl-
              edge and --http3. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http2-prior-knowledge
              (HTTP) Tells curl to  issue  its  non-TLS  HTTP  requests  using
              HTTP/2  without  HTTP/1.1  Upgrade.  It requires prior knowledge
              that the server supports HTTP/2 straight  away.  HTTPS  requests
              will  still  do HTTP/2 the standard way with negotiated protocol
              version in the TLS handshake.

              Providing --http2-prior-knowledge multiple times  has  no  extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-http2-prior-knowledge.

              Example:
               curl --http2-prior-knowledge https://example.com

              See  also  --http2 and --http3. --http2-prior-knowledge requires
              that the underlying libcurl was built to  support  HTTP/2.  This
              option  is mutually exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and
              --http2 and --http3. Added in 7.49.0.

       --http2
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

              For HTTPS, this means curl will attempt to negotiate  HTTP/2  in
              the TLS handshake. curl does this by default.

              For HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to
              HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request header.

              When curl uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself  insist  on
              TLS 1.2 or higher even though that is required by the specifica-
              tion. A user can add this version requirement with --tlsv1.2.

              Providing --http2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http2 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http3. --http2 requires that the under-
              lying  libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. This option is mutu-
              ally exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2-prior-
              knowledge and --http3. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http3-only
              (HTTP)  **WARNING**:  this option is experimental. Do not use in
              production.

              Instructs curl to use HTTP/3 to the host in  the  URL,  with  no
              fallback  to  earlier HTTP versions. HTTP/3 can only be used for
              HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs. For HTTP, this option will  trigger
              an error.

              This  option  allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc method of
              upgrading to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks  HTTP/3
              on the given host and port.

              This  option  will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be
              established, it will not attempt any other HTTP version  on  its
              own. Use --http3 for similar functionality with a fallback.

              Providing --http3-only multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http3-only https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1, --http2 and --http3. --http3-only requires
              that the underlying libcurl was built to  support  HTTP/3.  This
              option  is mutually exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and
              --http2  and  --http2-prior-knowledge  and  --http3.  Added   in
              7.88.0.

       --http3
              (HTTP)  **WARNING**:  this option is experimental. Do not use in
              production.

              Tells curl to try HTTP/3 to the host in the URL, but fallback to
              earlier  HTTP  versions  if  the HTTP/3 connection establishment
              fails. HTTP/3 is only available for HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs.

              This option allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc  method  of
              upgrading  to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks HTTP/3
              on the given host and port.

              When asked to use HTTP/3, curl will issue a separate attempt  to
              use  older  HTTP  versions with a slight delay, so if the HTTP/3
              transfer fails or is very slow, curl will still try  to  proceed
              with an older HTTP version.

              Use --http3-only for similar functionality without a fallback.

              Providing --http3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http3 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. --http3 requires that the under-
              lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/3. This option is  mutu-
              ally  exclusive  to  --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and
              --http2-prior-knowledge and --http3-only. Added in 7.66.0.

       --ignore-content-length
              (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is
              particularly  useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will
              report incorrect Content-Length for files larger  than  2  giga-
              bytes.

              For  FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the
              size before downloading a file.

              This option does not work for HTTP if libcurl was built  to  use
              hyper.

              Providing  --ignore-content-length  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ignore-content-length.

              Example:
               curl --ignore-content-length https://example.com

              See also --ftp-skip-pasv-ip.

       -i, --include
              Include the HTTP response headers in the output.  The  HTTP  re-
              sponse  headers  can  include  things like server name, cookies,
              date of the document, HTTP version and more...

              To view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.

              Providing -i, --include multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-include.

              Example:
               curl -i https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose.

       -k, --insecure
              (TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl makes is
              verified to be secure before the transfer takes place. This  op-
              tion  makes  curl skip the verification step and proceed without
              checking.

              When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl veri-
              fies  the server's TLS certificate before it continues: that the
              certificate contains the right name which matches the host  name
              used in the URL and that the certificate has been signed by a CA
              certificate present in the cert store.  See this online resource
              for further details:
               https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

              For  SFTP  and  SCP, this option makes curl skip the known_hosts
              verification.  known_hosts is a  file  normally  stored  in  the
              user's home directory in the ".ssh" subdirectory, which contains
              host names and their public keys.

              WARNING: using this option makes the transfer insecure.

              When curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses  and  allows
              for  example  HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be stored and used
              subsequently. Using -k, --insecure can make curl trust  and  use
              such information from malicious servers.

              Providing  -k,  --insecure  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --insecure https://example.com

              See also --proxy-insecure, --cacert and --capath.

       --interface <name>
              Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can  enter
              interface  name,  IP address or host name. An example could look
              like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

              On Linux it can be used to specify a VRF, but the  binary  needs
              to  either  have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root. More informa-
              tion  about  Linux  VRF:   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documenta-
              tion/networking/vrf.txt

              If  --interface  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface.

       -4, --ipv4
              This option tells curl to use IPv4 addresses only, and  not  for
              example try IPv6.

              Providing  -4,  --ipv4 multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ipv4.

              Example:
               curl --ipv4 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. This option is  mutually  exclu-
              sive to -6, --ipv6.

       -6, --ipv6
              This  option  tells curl to use IPv6 addresses only, and not for
              example try IPv4.

              Providing -6, --ipv6 multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-ipv6.

              Example:
               curl --ipv6 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1 and --http2. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to -4, --ipv4.

       --json <data>
              (HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST  request  to  the
              HTTP  server.  --json  works  as a shortcut for passing on these
              three options:

               --data [arg]
               --header "Content-Type: application/json"
               --header "Accept: application/json"

              There is no verification that the passed in data is actual  JSON
              or that the syntax is correct.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              file name to read the data from, or a single  dash  (-)  if  you
              want  curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file
              named 'foobar' would thus be done with --json @foobar and to in-
              stead read the data from stdin, use --json @-.

              If  this option is used more than once on the same command line,
              the additional data pieces will be concatenated to the  previous
              before sending.

              The headers this option sets can be overridden with -H, --header
              as usual.

              --json can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --json '{ "drink": "coffe" }' https://example.com
               curl --json '{ "drink":' --json ' "coffe" }' https://example.com
               curl --json @prepared https://example.com
               curl --json @- https://example.com < json.txt

              See also --data-binary and --data-raw. This option  is  mutually
              exclusive  to  -F,  --form and -I, --head and -T, --upload-file.
              Added in 7.82.0.

       -j, --junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
              option will make it discard all "session cookies". This will ba-
              sically have the same effect as if a  new  session  is  started.
              Typical  browsers  always  discard session cookies when they are
              closed down.

              Providing -j, --junk-session-cookies multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-junk-session-cookies.

              Example:
               curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt https://example.com

              See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.

       --keepalive-time <seconds>
              This  option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle be-
              fore sending keepalive probes and the  time  between  individual
              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
              (meaning  Linux,  recent  AIX,  HP-UX and more).  Keepalives are
              used by the TCP stack to detect broken networks on idle  connec-
              tions.  The  number  of missed keepalive probes before declaring
              the connection down is OS dependent and is  commonly  9  or  10.
              This option has no effect if --no-keepalive is used.

              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

              If  --keepalive-time  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --keepalive-time 20 https://example.com

              See also --no-keepalive and -m, --max-time.

       --key-type <type>
              (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your --key  pro-
              vided  private  key  is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not
              specified, PEM is assumed.

              If --key-type is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --key-type DER --key here https://example.com

              See also --key.

       --key <key>
              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
              vate key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified,  curl
              tries   the  following  candidates  in  order:  '~/.ssh/id_rsa',
              '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.

              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine  pkcs11
              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
              ify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A  string  begin-
              ning  with  "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a
              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
              "pkcs11"  if none was provided and the --key-type option will be
              set as "ENG" if none was provided.

              If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then  this
              option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc). Those backends
              expect the private key to be already present in the keychain  or
              PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.

              If  --key  is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com

              See also --key-type and -E, --cert.

       --krb <level>
              (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must  be
              entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
              'private'. Should you use a level that  is  not  one  of  these,
              'private' will instead be used.

              If  --krb  is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/

              See also --delegation and --ssl. --krb requires that the  under-
              lying libcurl was built to support Kerberos.

       --libcurl <file>
              Append  this  option  to any ordinary curl command line, and you
              will get libcurl-using C source code written to  the  file  that
              does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --libcurl is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose.

       --limit-rate <speed>
              Specify  the  maximum  transfer  rate you want curl to use - for
              both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a
              limited  pipe  and  you would like your transfer not to use your
              entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.

              The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is
              appended.   Appending  'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilo-
              bytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes  it
              gigabytes.  The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For ex-
              ample 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

              The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed to
              no  more  than  the set threshold over a period of multiple sec-
              onds.

              If you also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that  option  will
              take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to
              help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

              If --limit-rate is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com
               curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com
               curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com

              See also --rate, -Y, --speed-limit and -y, --speed-time.

       -l, --list-only
              (FTP  POP3)  (FTP)  When  listing  an FTP directory, this switch
              forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if  the  user
              wants  to  machine-parse  the contents of an FTP directory since
              the normal directory view does not use a standard look  or  for-
              mat.  When  used like this, the option causes an NLST command to
              be sent to the server instead of LIST.

              Note: Some FTP servers list only  files  in  their  response  to
              NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.

              (POP3)  When  retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch
              forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR.  This  is
              particularly  useful if the user wants to see if a specific mes-
              sage-id exists on the server and what size it is.

              Note: When combined with -X, --request, this option can be  used
              to  send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's
              unique identifier rather than its message-id  to  make  the  re-
              quest.

              Providing  -l,  --list-only  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-list-only.

              Example:
               curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/

              See also -Q, --quote and -X, --request.

       --local-port <num/range>
              Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of  local  port
              numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by
              nature are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so  set-
              ting  this range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary
              connection setup failures.

              If --local-port is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com

              See also -g, --globoff.

       --location-trusted
              (HTTP)  Like  -L,  --location, but will allow sending the name +
              password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or
              may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to
              a site to which you will send your authentication info (which is
              plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

              Providing --location-trusted multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-location-trusted.

              Example:
               curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com

              See also -u, --user.

       -L, --location
              (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page  has  moved
              to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a
              3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the  request
              on  the  new  place.  If used together with -i, --include or -I,
              --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When au-
              thentication  is  used,  curl  only sends its credentials to the
              initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different  host,  it
              will  not be able to intercept the user+password. See also --lo-
              cation-trusted on how to change this. You can limit  the  amount
              of redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

              When  curl  follows  a redirect and if the request is a POST, it
              will send the following request with a GET if the HTTP  response
              was  301,  302,  or  303. If the response code was any other 3xx
              code, curl will re-send the following request using the same un-
              modified method.

              You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x
              response by using the dedicated  options  for  that:  --post301,
              --post302 and --post303.

              The  method  set  with  -X,  --request overrides the method curl
              would otherwise select to use.

              Providing -L, --location multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-location.

              Example:
               curl -L https://example.com

              See also --resolve and --alt-svc.

       --login-options <options>
              (IMAP  LDAP  POP3  SMTP) Specify the login options to use during
              server authentication.

              You can use login options to specify protocol  specific  options
              that  may  be  used during authentication. At present only IMAP,
              POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more information  about
              login  options  please  see  RFC  2384,  RFC 5092 and IETF draft
              draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt

              If --login-options is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com

              See also -u, --user. Added in 7.34.0.

       --mail-auth <address>
              (SMTP)  Specify  a  single address. This will be used to specify
              the authentication address (identity)  of  a  submitted  message
              that is being relayed to another server.

              If  --mail-auth  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from.

       --mail-from <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail  should  get
              sent from.

              If  --mail-from  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth.

       --mail-rcpt-allowfails
              (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl
              will  abort  SMTP conversation if at least one of the recipients
              causes RCPT TO command to return an error.

              The default behavior can be changed by  passing  --mail-rcpt-al-
              lowfails  command-line option which will make curl ignore errors
              and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.

              If all recipients trigger RCPT TO  failures  and  this  flag  is
              specified,  curl  will still abort the SMTP conversation and re-
              turn the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.

              Providing --mail-rcpt-allowfails multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.

              Example:
               curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

              See also --mail-rcpt. Added in 7.69.0.

       --mail-rcpt <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or mailing list
              name. Repeat this option several times to send to  multiple  re-
              cipients.

              When  performing an address verification (VRFY command), the re-
              cipient should be specified as the user name or  user  name  and
              domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-
              ient should be specified using the mailing list  name,  such  as
              "Friends" or "London-Office".  (Added in 7.34.0)

              --mail-rcpt can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com

              See also --mail-rcpt-allowfails.

       -M, --manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

              Example:
               curl --manual

              See also -v, --verbose, --libcurl and --trace.

       --max-filesize <bytes>
              (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to
              download. If the file requested is larger than this  value,  the
              transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              A  size  modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or 'K'
              will count  the  number  as  kilobytes,  'm'  or  'M'  makes  it
              megabytes,  while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K,
              3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)

              NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to  download,  and
              for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
              fer ends up being larger than this given limit.  If  --max-file-
              size is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --max-filesize 100K https://example.com

              See also --limit-rate.

       --max-redirs <num>
              (HTTP)  Set  maximum  number of redirections to follow. When -L,
              --location is used, to prevent  curl  from  following  too  many
              redirects,  by  default,  the  limit is set to 50 redirects. Set
              this option to -1 to make it unlimited.

              If --max-redirs is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --max-redirs 3 --location https://example.com

              See also -L, --location.

       -m, --max-time <fractional seconds>
              Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow each transfer to take.
              This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hanging  for
              hours  due  to slow networks or links going down.  Since 7.32.0,
              this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout  will
              decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in deci-
              mal precision.

              If you enable retrying the transfer (--retry) then  the  maximum
              time counter is reset each time the transfer is retried. You can
              use --retry-max-time to limit the retry time.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If -m, --max-time is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --max-time 10 https://example.com
               curl --max-time 2.92 https://example.com

              See also --connect-timeout and --retry-max-time.

       --metalink
              This  option was previously used to specify a metalink resource.
              Metalink support has been disabled in curl since 7.78.0 for  se-
              curity reasons.

              If --metalink is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --metalink file https://example.com

              See also -Z, --parallel.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

              This option requires a library built with GSS-API or  SSPI  sup-
              port.  Use  -V,  --version  to  see  if  your curl supports GSS-
              API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

              When using this option, you must also provide a fake -u,  --user
              option  to  activate the authentication code properly. Sending a
              '-u :' is enough as the user name  and  password  from  the  -u,
              --user option are not actually used.

              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
              used.

              Providing --negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --negotiate -u : https://example.com

              See also --basic, --ntlm, --anyauth and --proxy-negotiate.

       --netrc-file <filename>
              This option is similar to -n, --netrc, except that  you  provide
              the  path  (absolute  or  relative)  to the netrc file that curl
              should use. You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.

              It will abide by --netrc-optional if specified.

              If --netrc-file is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --netrc-file netrc https://example.com

              See  also  -n, --netrc, -u, --user and -K, --config. This option
              is mutually exclusive to -n, --netrc.

       --netrc-optional
              Similar to -n, --netrc, but this option makes the  .netrc  usage
              optional and not mandatory as the -n, --netrc option does.

              Providing  --netrc-optional  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-netrc-optional.

              Example:
               curl --netrc-optional https://example.com

              See also --netrc-file. This option is mutually exclusive to  -n,
              --netrc.

       -n, --netrc
              Makes  curl  scan  the  .netrc  (_netrc  on Windows) file in the
              user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
              cally  used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable
              user authentication. See netrc(5) and ftp(1) for details on  the
              file  format.  Curl will not complain if that file does not have
              the right permissions (it should be neither  world-  nor  group-
              readable).  The  environment variable "HOME" is used to find the
              home directory.

              A quick and simple example of how to setup  a  .netrc  to  allow
              curl  to  FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name 'my-
              self' and password 'secret' could look similar to:

               machine host.domain.com
               login myself
               password secret

              Providing -n, --netrc multiple times has no extra effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-netrc.

              Example:
               curl --netrc https://example.com

              See  also --netrc-file, -K, --config and -u, --user. This option
              is mutually exclusive to --netrc-file and --netrc-optional.

       -:, --next
              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
              associated  options.  This  allows  you  to send several URL re-
              quests, each with their own specific options, for example,  such
              as different user names or custom requests for each.

              -:,  --next  will  reset  all local options and only global ones
              will have their values survive over to the  operation  following
              the  -:,  --next  instruction. Global options include -v, --ver-
              bose, --trace, --trace-ascii and --fail-early.

              For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a  single  com-
              mand line:

               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

              -:, --next can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl https://example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
               curl -I https://example.com --next https://example.net/

              See also -Z, --parallel and -K, --config. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-alpn
              (HTTPS)  Disable  the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by de-
              fault if libcurl was built with an  SSL  library  that  supports
              ALPN.  ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negoti-
              ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.

              Providing --no-alpn multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --alpn.

              Example:
               curl --no-alpn https://example.com

              See  also  --no-npn and --http2. --no-alpn requires that the un-
              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       -N, --no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-
              uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
              will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
              necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
              will disable that buffering.

              Providing -N, --no-buffer multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --buffer.

              Example:
               curl --no-buffer https://example.com

              See also -#, --progress-bar.

       --no-clobber
              When  used  in  conjunction with the -o, --output, -J, --remote-
              header-name, -O, --remote-name,  or  --remote-name-all  options,
              curl avoids overwriting files that already exist. Instead, a dot
              and a number gets appended to the name of the file that would be
              created,  up  to filename.100 after which it will not create any
              file.

              Note that this is the negated option name documented.   You  can
              thus  use --clobber to enforce the clobbering, even if -J, --re-
              mote-header-name is specified.

              Providing --no-clobber multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --clobber.

              Example:
               curl --no-clobber --output local/dir/file https://example.com

              See also -o, --output and -O, --remote-name. Added in 7.83.0.

       --no-keepalive
              Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection.
              curl otherwise enables them by default.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.

              Providing  --no-keepalive  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --keepalive.

              Example:
               curl --no-keepalive https://example.com

              See also --keepalive-time.

       --no-npn
              (HTTPS) In curl 7.86.0 and later, curl never uses NPN.

              Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN  is  enabled  by  default  if
              libcurl  was built with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN is
              used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2  sup-
              port with the server during https sessions.

              Providing  --no-npn multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --npn.

              Example:
               curl --no-npn https://example.com

              See also --no-alpn and --http2. --no-npn requires that  the  un-
              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-progress-meter
              Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or
              otherwise affecting warning and informational messages like  -s,
              --silent does.

              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
              thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter again.

              Providing --no-progress-meter multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --progress-meter.

              Example:
               curl --no-progress-meter -o store https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.

       --no-sessionid
              (TLS)  Disable  curl's use of SSL session-ID caching. By default
              all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while  nothing
              should  ever  get  hurt  by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs,
              there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
              require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.

              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
              thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

              Providing --no-sessionid multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --sessionid.

              Example:
               curl --no-sessionid https://example.com

              See also -k, --insecure.

       --noproxy <no-proxy-list>
              Comma-separated  list  of hosts for which not to use a proxy, if
              one is specified. The only wildcard is  a  single  *  character,
              which  matches  all  hosts,  and effectively disables the proxy.
              Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which  con-
              tains  the  hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, lo-
              cal.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and  www.local.com,
              but not www.notlocal.com.

              Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables
              that disable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY').  If  there's
              an  environment  variable disabling a proxy, you can set the no-
              proxy list to "" to override it.

              Since 7.86.0, IP addresses specified to this option can be  pro-
              vided  using  CIDR notation: an appended slash and number speci-
              fies the number of "network bits" out of the address to  use  in
              the comparison. For example "192.168.0.0/16" would match all ad-
              dresses starting with "192.168".

              If --noproxy is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --noproxy "www.example" https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy.

       --ntlm-wb
              (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style --ntlm does, but hand over
              the authentication to the separate binary  ntlmauth  application
              that is executed when needed.

              Providing --ntlm-wb multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --ntlm-wb -u user:password https://example.com

              See also --ntlm and --proxy-ntlm.

       --ntlm (HTTP)  Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM authentication
              method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
              It  is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever peo-
              ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
              behavior  should  not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone
              who uses NTLM to switch to a public and  documented  authentica-
              tion method instead, such as Digest.

              If  you  want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then
              use --proxy-ntlm.

              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
              used.

              Providing --ntlm multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --ntlm -u user:password https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-ntlm.  --ntlm  requires  that  the underlying
              libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to --basic and --negotiate and --digest and --anyauth.

       --oauth2-bearer <token>
              (IMAP  LDAP  POP3  SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH
              2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token is used in  conjunc-
              tion  with  the  user name which can be specified as part of the
              --url or -u, --user options.

              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted  according  to  RFC
              6750.

              If --oauth2-bearer is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --oauth2-bearer "mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM" https://example.com

              See also --basic, --ntlm and --digest. Added in 7.33.0.

       --output-dir <dir>
              This option specifies the directory in  which  files  should  be
              stored, when -O, --remote-name or -o, --output are used.

              The  given  output directory is used for all URLs and output op-
              tions on the command line, up until the first -:, --next.

              If the specified target directory does not exist, the  operation
              will fail unless --create-dirs is also used.

              If  --output-dir  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --output-dir "tmp" -O https://example.com

              See also -O, --remote-name and -J,  --remote-header-name.  Added
              in 7.73.0.

       -o, --output <file>
              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
              [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the URL and you
              can  use  '#' followed by a number in the <file> specifier. That
              variable will be replaced with the current string  for  the  URL
              being fetched. Like in:

               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com" -o "#1_#2"

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the  same  command
              line, you can use it like this:

                curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

              and  the  order  of the -o options and the URLs does not matter,
              just that the first -o is for the first URL and so  on,  so  the
              above command line can also be written as

                curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

              See  also  the --create-dirs option to create the local directo-
              ries dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a  single  dash)
              will force the output to be done to stdout.

              To   suppress  response  bodies,  you  can  redirect  output  to
              /dev/null:

                curl example.com -o /dev/null

              Or for Windows use nul:

                curl example.com -o nul

              -o, --output can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -o file https://example.com
               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"
               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com" -o "#1_#2"
               curl -o file https://example.com -o file2 https://example.net

              See also -O, --remote-name, --remote-name-all and -J,  --remote-
              header-name.

       --parallel-immediate
              When  doing  parallel  transfers, this option will instruct curl
              that it should rather prefer opening up more connections in par-
              allel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be
              added as multiplexed streams on another connection.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing  --parallel-immediate  multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-parallel-immediate.

              Example:
               curl --parallel-immediate -Z https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

              See also -Z, --parallel and --parallel-max. Added in 7.68.0.

       --parallel-max <num>
              When asked to do parallel transfers, using -Z, --parallel,  this
              option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do simultane-
              ously.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              The default is 50.

              If  --parallel-max is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --parallel-max 100 -Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

              See also -Z, --parallel. Added in 7.66.0.

       -Z, --parallel
              Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to  the
              regular serial manner.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -Z, --parallel multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-parallel.

              Example:
               curl --parallel https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

              See also -:, --next and -v, --verbose. Added in 7.66.0.

       --pass <phrase>
              (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.

              If  --pass is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --pass secret --key file https://example.com

              See also --key and -u, --user.

       --path-as-is
              Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./  in  the  given
              URL  path.  Normally curl will squash or merge them according to
              standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

              Providing --path-as-is multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-path-as-is.

              Example:
               curl --path-as-is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd

              See also --request-target. Added in 7.42.0.

       --pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use  the  specified  public key file (or
              hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a  file  which
              contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
              of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
              rated by ';'.

              When  negotiating  a  TLS  or SSL connection, the server sends a
              certificate indicating its identity. A public key  is  extracted
              from  this certificate and if it does not exactly match the pub-
              lic key provided to this option, curl will abort the  connection
              before sending or receiving any data.

              PEM/DER support:

              7.39.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit

              7.43.0: NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              sha256 support:

              7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              Other SSL backends not supported.

              If  --pinnedpubkey is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl --pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

              See also --hostpubsha256. Added in 7.39.0.

       --post301
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
              non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
              may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post301 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post301.

              Example:
               curl --post301 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post302, --post303 and -L, --location.

       --post302
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
              non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
              may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post302 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post302.

              Example:
               curl --post302 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post301, --post303 and -L, --location.

       --post303
              (HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST
              requests  into  GET  requests when following 303 redirections. A
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirect-
              ion. This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post303 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post303.

              Example:
               curl --post303 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post302, --post301 and -L, --location.

       --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to  an  HTTP  or
              HTTPS  -x,  --proxy.  In  such a case curl first connects to the
              SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS)  to  the  HTTP  or
              HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.

              The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-
              fix to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use  socks4://,
              socks4a://,  socks5://  or  socks5h://  to  request the specific
              SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified will  make  curl
              default to SOCKS4.

              If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
              assumed to be 1080.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
              URL  decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special charac-
              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              If --preproxy is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --socks5. Added in 7.52.0.

       -#, --progress-bar
              Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar in-
              stead of the standard, more informational, meter.

              This progress bar draws a single line of '#'  characters  across
              the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.
              For transfers without a known size, there  will  be  space  ship
              (-=o=-)  that  moves back and forth but only while data is being
              transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -#, --progress-bar multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-progress-bar.

              Example:
               curl -# -O https://example.com

              See also --styled-output.

       --proto-default <protocol>
              Tells curl to use protocol for any URL missing a scheme name.

              An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  CURLE_UNSUP-
              PORTED_PROTOCOL (1).

              This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

              Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the host
              name, see --url for details.

              If --proto-default is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proto-default https ftp.example.com

              See also --proto and --proto-redir. Added in 7.45.0.

       --proto-redir <protocols>
              Tells  curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect. Pro-
              tocols denied by --proto are not overridden by this option.  See
              --proto for how protocols are represented.

              Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

               curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com

              By default curl will only allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on re-
              direct (since 7.65.2). Specifying all or +all enables all proto-
              cols on redirects, which is not good for security.

              If  --proto-redir  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com

              See also --proto.

       --proto <protocols>
              Tells curl to limit what protocols it  may  use  for  transfers.
              Protocols  are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and
              are each a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed  by  zero
              or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:

              +  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-
                 ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

              -  Deny this protocol, removing it from the  list  of  protocols
                 already permitted.

              =  Permit  only this protocol (ignoring the list already permit-
                 ted), though subject to later modification by subsequent  en-
                 tries in the comma separated list.

              For example:

              --proto -ftps  uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

              --proto -all,https,+http
                             only enables http and https

              --proto =http,https
                             also only enables http and https

              Unknown  and  disabled  protocols produce a warning. This allows
              scripts to safely rely on being able to disable potentially dan-
              gerous protocols, without relying upon support for that protocol
              being built into curl to avoid an error.

              This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect
              is  the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of
              the option.

              If --proto is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

              See also --proto-redir and --proto-default.

       --proxy-anyauth
              Tells  curl to pick a suitable authentication method when commu-
              nicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might  cause  an  extra
              request/response round-trip.

              Providing --proxy-anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-basic and --proxy-digest.

       --proxy-basic
              Tells  curl  to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a
              remote  host.  Basic  is  the default authentication method curl
              uses with proxies.

              Providing --proxy-basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-digest.

       --proxy-cacert <file>
              Same as --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-cacert is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-capath,  --cacert,  --capath and -x, --proxy.
              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-capath <dir>
              Same as --capath but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-capath is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-capath /local/directory -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-cacert,  -x,  --proxy  and --capath. Added in
              7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert-type <type>
              Same as --cert-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-cert-type is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cert-type PEM --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-cert. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert <cert[:passwd]>
              Same as -E, --cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-cert  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-cert-type. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-ciphers <list>
              Same as --ciphers but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-ciphers is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --ciphers, --curves and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-crlfile <file>
              Same as --crlfile but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-crlfile is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-crlfile rejects.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --crlfile and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-digest
              Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when  communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with
              a remote host.

              Providing --proxy-digest multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy-header <header/@file>
              (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP
              to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is
              the equivalent option to -H, --header but is for proxy  communi-
              cation  only  like  in CONNECT requests when you want a separate
              header sent to the proxy to what is sent to  the  actual  remote
              host.

              curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              Headers specified with this option will not be included  in  re-
              quests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.

              Starting  in  7.55.0, this option can take an argument in @file-
              name style, which then adds a header for each line in the  input
              file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.

              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
              multiple headers.

              --proxy-header can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --proxy-header "X-First-Name: Joe" -x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl --proxy-header "User-Agent: surprise" -x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl --proxy-header "Host:" -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

       --proxy-insecure
              Same as -k, --insecure but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-insecure multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-proxy-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-insecure -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and -k, --insecure. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key-type <type>
              Same as --key-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-key-type  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-key-type DER --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-key and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key <key>
              Same as --key but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-key is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-key-type and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-negotiate
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when
              communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for enabling
              HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

              Providing --proxy-negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-negotiate --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy-ntlm
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling NTLM with a remote
              host.

              Providing --proxy-ntlm multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ntlm --proxy-user user:passwd -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-negotiate and --proxy-anyauth.

       --proxy-pass <phrase>
              Same as --pass but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-pass  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-pass secret --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-key. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  public  key  file  (or
              hashes)  to verify the proxy. This can be a path to a file which
              contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
              of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
              rated by ';'.

              When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection,  the  server  sends  a
              certificate  indicating  its identity. A public key is extracted
              from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the  pub-
              lic  key provided to this option, curl will abort the connection
              before sending or receiving any data.

              If --proxy-pinnedpubkey is provided several times, the last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

              See also --pinnedpubkey and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.59.0.

       --proxy-service-name <name>
              This  option allows you to change the service name for proxy ne-
              gotiation.

              If --proxy-service-name is provided several times, the last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-service-name "shrubbery" -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --service-name and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.43.0.

       --proxy-ssl-allow-beast
              Same as --ssl-allow-beast but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing  --proxy-ssl-allow-beast  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-proxy-ssl-allow-beast.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ssl-allow-beast -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --ssl-allow-beast and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert
              Same as --ssl-auto-client-cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert multiple times has no ex-
              tra  effect.   Disable it again with --no-proxy-ssl-auto-client-
              cert.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --ssl-auto-client-cert  and  -x,  --proxy.  Added  in
              7.77.0.

       --proxy-tls13-ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS)  Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection to
              your HTTPS proxy when it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers
              suites  must  specify  valid  ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher
              suite details on this URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl  is  built  to  use
              OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
              you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the  --proxy-
              ciphers option.

              If --proxy-tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --tls13-ciphers and --curves. Added in 7.61.0.

       --proxy-tlsauthtype <type>
              Same as --tlsauthtype but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-tlsauthtype is provided several times, the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsauthtype SRP -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlsuser. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlspassword <string>
              Same as --tlspassword but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-tlspassword  is provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlspassword passwd -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlsuser. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsuser <name>
              Same as --tlsuser but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-tlsuser is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsuser smith -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlspassword. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsv1
              Same as -1, --tlsv1 but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsv1 -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       -U, --proxy-user <user:password>
              Specify  the user name and password to use for proxy authentica-
              tion.

              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either  Ne-
              gotiate  or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to select
              the user name and password from your environment by specifying a
              single colon with this option: "-U :".

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
              ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-
              dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same
              system as they  will  still  be  visible  for  a  moment  before
              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.

              If -U, --proxy-user is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-pass.

       -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified proxy.

              The  proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No
              protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
              socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a spe-
              cific SOCKS version to be used.

              Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set localhost
              for the host part. e.g. socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              HTTPS  proxy  support  via https:// protocol prefix was added in
              7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.

              Unrecognized and unsupported  proxy  protocols  cause  an  error
              since  7.52.0.   Prior  versions may ignore the protocol and use
              http:// instead.

              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,  it  is
              assumed to be 1080.

              This  option  overrides  existing environment variables that set
              the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable  setting  a
              proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.

              All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will trans-
              parently be converted to HTTP. It means  that  certain  protocol
              specific operations might not be available. This is not the case
              if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --prox-
              ytunnel option.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
              URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special  charac-
              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              The  proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy envi-
              ronment variables, including the protocol prefix  (http://)  and
              the embedded user + password.

              When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with -P, --ftp-
              port, cannot be used.

              If -x, --proxy is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com

              See also --socks5 and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy1.0 <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy  option  -x,
              --proxy,  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will
              specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

              Providing --proxy1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --socks5 and --preproxy.

       -p, --proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used -x, --proxy, this  option  will  make
              curl  tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with
              the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the  proxy  al-
              lows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tun-
              nel through to.

              To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is  set  to
              output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.

              Providing  -p, --proxytunnel multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-proxytunnel.

              Example:
               curl --proxytunnel -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy.

       --pubkey <key>
              (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-
              lic key in this separate file.

              (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public
              key from the private key file, so passing this option is  gener-
              ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
              libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8  or  higher
              that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)

              If  --pubkey  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/

              See also --pass.

       -Q, --quote <command>
              (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP  or  SFTP
              server.  Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place
              (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP  transfer,  to  be
              exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
              prefix them with a dash '-'.

              (FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has  changed  the
              working  directory,  just  before  the file transfer command(s),
              prefix the command with a '+'. This is not performed when a  di-
              rectory listing is performed.

              You may specify any number of commands.

              By  default  curl  will stop at first failure. To make curl con-
              tinue even if the command fails, prefix the command with an  as-
              terisk  (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of
              the commands, the entire operation will be aborted.

              You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959  de-
              fines  to  FTP  servers,  or one of the commands listed below to
              SFTP servers.

              This option can be used multiple times.

              SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets  SFTP
              quote  commands  itself  before sending them to the server. File
              names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special char-
              acters.  Following  is the list of all supported SFTP quote com-
              mands:

              atime date file
                     The atime command sets the last access time of  the  file
                     named  by  the file operand. The <date expression> can be
                     all sorts of date strings, see  the  curl_getdate(3)  man
                     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              chgrp group file
                     The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by
                     the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group
                     operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

              chmod mode file
                     The  chmod  command  modifies  the  file mode bits of the
                     specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                     number.

              chown user file
                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                     file operand to the user ID specified by the  user  oper-
                     and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

              ln source_file target_file
                     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                     target_file location pointing to  the  source_file  loca-
                     tion.

              mkdir directory_name
                     The  mkdir command creates the directory named by the di-
                     rectory_name operand.

              mtime date file
                     The mtime command sets the last modification time of  the
                     file named by the file operand. The <date expression> can
                     be all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man
                     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                     rent working directory.

              rename source target
                     The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                     the  source  operand to the destination path named by the
                     target operand.

              rm file
                     The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                     erand.

              rmdir directory
                     The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified
                     by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

              symlink source_file target_file
                     See ln.

       -Q, --quote can be used several times in a command line

       Example:
        curl --quote "DELE file" ftp://example.com/foo

       See also -X, --request.

       --random-file <file>
              Deprecated option. This option is ignored by curl since  7.84.0.
              Prior  to that it only had an effect on curl if built to use old
              versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered
              as  random  data. The data may be used to seed the random engine
              for SSL connections.

              If --random-file is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --random-file rubbish https://example.com

              See also --egd-file.

       -r, --range <range>
              (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial docu-
              ment) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP  server  or  a  local  FILE.
              Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              0-499     specifies the first 500 bytes

              500-999   specifies the second 500 bytes

              -500      specifies the last 500 bytes

              9500-     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

              0-0,-1    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)

              100-199,500-599
                        specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)

              (*)  = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a mul-
              tipart response, which will be returned as-is by  curl!  Parsing
              or otherwise transforming this response is the responsibility of
              the caller.

              Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and  'stop'
              fields  of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit charac-
              ter is given in the range, the server's response will be unspec-
              ified, depending on the server's configuration.

              You  should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have
              this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to get  a  range,
              you will instead get the whole document.

              FTP  and  SFTP  range  downloads only support the simple 'start-
              stop' syntax (optionally with one of the numbers  omitted).  FTP
              use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

              If  -r,  --range  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --range 22-44 https://example.com

              See also -C, --continue-at and -a, --append.

       --rate <max request rate>
              Specify the maximum transfer frequency you allow curl to  use  -
              in number of transfer starts per time unit (sometimes called re-
              quest rate). Without this  option,  curl  will  start  the  next
              transfer as fast as possible.

              If  given  several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the
              allowed rate, curl will wait until the next transfer is  started
              to  maintain  the requested rate. This option has no effect when
              -Z, --parallel is used.

              The request rate is provided as "N/U" where N is an integer num-
              ber  and U is a time unit. Supported units are 's' (second), 'm'
              (minute), 'h' (hour) and 'd' /(day, as in a 24 hour  unit).  The
              default  time  unit, if no "/U" is provided, is number of trans-
              fers per hour.

              If curl is told to allow 10 requests per  minute,  it  will  not
              start  the  next  request until 6 seconds have elapsed since the
              previous transfer was started.

              This function uses millisecond resolution. If the  allowed  fre-
              quency is set more than 1000 per second, it will instead run un-
              restricted.

              When retrying transfers,  enabled  with  --retry,  the  separate
              retry delay logic is used and not this setting.

              If  --rate is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Examples:
               curl --rate 2/s https://example.com
               curl --rate 3/h https://example.com
               curl --rate 14/m https://example.com

              See also --limit-rate and --retry-delay. Added in 7.84.0.

       --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of con-
              tent  or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed on un-
              altered, raw.

              Providing --raw multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable  it
              again with --no-raw.

              Example:
               curl --raw https://example.com

              See also --tr-encoding.

       -e, --referer <URL>
              (HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server.
              This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When
              used  with  -L,  --location  you  can  append ";auto" to the -e,
              --referer URL to make curl automatically set  the  previous  URL
              when  it  follows  a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be
              used alone, even if you do not set an initial -e, --referer.

              If -e, --referer is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --referer "https://fake.example" https://example.com
               curl --referer "https://fake.example;auto" -L https://example.com
               curl --referer ";auto" -L https://example.com

              See also -A, --user-agent and -H, --header.

       -J, --remote-header-name
              (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the
              server-specified Content-Disposition  filename  instead  of  ex-
              tracting  a  filename  from the URL. If the server-provided file
              name contains a path, that will be stripped off before the  file
              name is used.

              The  file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory
              specified with --output-dir.

              If the server specifies a file name and a file  with  that  name
              already  exists  in  the  destination  directory, it will not be
              overwritten and an error will occur - unless you allow it by us-
              ing  the --clobber option. If the server does not specify a file
              name then this option has no effect.

              There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in  the  provided
              file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
              file names.

              This feature uses the name from the "filename"  field,  it  does
              not  yet  support the "filename*" field (filenames with explicit
              character sets).

              WARNING: Exercise judicious use of this  option,  especially  on
              Windows.  A  rogue  server  could  send you the name of a DLL or
              other file that could be loaded automatically by Windows or some
              third party software.

              Providing  -J,  --remote-header-name multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-header-name.

              Example:
               curl -OJ https://example.com/file

              See also -O, --remote-name.

       --remote-name-all
              This option changes the default action for all given URLs to  be
              dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each one. So if
              you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-
              all has been used, you must use "-o -" or --no-remote-name.

              Providing  --remote-name-all multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remote-name-all.

              Example:
               curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2

              See also -O, --remote-name.

       -O, --remote-name
              Write output to a local file named like the remote file we  get.
              (Only  the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
              off.)

              The file will be saved in the current working directory. If  you
              want  the  file  saved  in  a different directory, make sure you
              change the current working directory before invoking  curl  with
              this option or use --output-dir.

              The  remote  file  name  to use for saving is extracted from the
              given URL, nothing else, and if it already  exists  it  will  be
              overwritten.  If  you  want  the server to be able to choose the
              file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in
              addition  to  this option. If the server chooses a file name and
              that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or
              other  URL  encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as
              file name.

              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs  you
              have.

              -O, --remote-name can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl -O https://example.com/filename

              See  also  --remote-name-all,  --output-dir  and  -J,  --remote-
              header-name.

       -R, --remote-time
              When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out  the  time-
              stamp  of the remote file, and if that is available make the lo-
              cal file get that same timestamp.

              Providing -R, --remote-time multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remote-time.

              Example:
               curl --remote-time -o foo https://example.com

              See also -O, --remote-name and -z, --time-cond.

       --remove-on-error
              When  curl  returns an error when told to save output in a local
              file, this option removes that saved file before  exiting.  This
              prevents  curl from leaving a partial file in the case of an er-
              ror during transfer.

              If the output is not a file, this option has no effect.

              Providing --remove-on-error multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remove-on-error.

              Example:
               curl --remove-on-error -o output https://example.com

              See also -f, --fail. Added in 7.83.0.

       --request-target <path>
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to use an alternative "target" (path) instead
              of using the path as provided in the  URL.  Particularly  useful
              when  wanting  to  issue  HTTP requests without leading slash or
              other data that does not follow the regular  URL  pattern,  like
              "OPTIONS *".

              If  --request-target  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --request-target "*" -X OPTIONS https://example.com

              See also -X, --request. Added in 7.55.0.

       -X, --request <method>
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
              ing  with  the HTTP server. The specified request method will be
              used instead of the method otherwise  used  (which  defaults  to
              GET).  Read  the HTTP 1.1 specification for details and explana-
              tions. Common additional HTTP requests include PUT  and  DELETE,
              but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE
              and more.

              Normally you do not need this option. All sorts  of  GET,  HEAD,
              POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-
              mand line options.

              This option only changes the actual word used in  the  HTTP  re-
              quest, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if
              you want to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD  will  not
              suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.

              The  method  string  you set with -X, --request will be used for
              all requests, which if you for example use  -L,  --location  may
              cause  unintended side-effects when curl does not change request
              method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
              doing file lists with FTP.

              (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or
              RETR.

              (IMAP) Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead  of  LIST.
              (Added in 7.30.0)

              (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or
              VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

              If -X, --request is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -X "DELETE" https://example.com
               curl -X NLST ftp://example.com/

              See also --request-target.

       --resolve <[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...>
              Provide  a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Us-
              ing this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified  ad-
              dress  and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to be
              used. Consider it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative  provided  on
              the  command line. The port number should be the number used for
              the specific protocol the host will be used for.  It  means  you
              need several entries if you want to provide address for the same
              host but different ports.

              By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any  host
              and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is re-
              solved last so any --resolve with a specific host and port  will
              be used first.

              The provided address set by this option will be used even if -4,
              --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6 is set to make curl use another IP version.

              By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry time out
              after  curl's  default  timeout  (1 minute). Note that this will
              only make sense for long running parallel transfers with  a  lot
              of files. In such cases, if this option is used curl will try to
              resolve the host as it normally would once the timeout  has  ex-
              pired.

              Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added
              in 7.57.0.

              Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was  added
              in 7.59.0.

              Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.

              Support for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.

              This option can be used many times to add many host names to re-
              solve.

              --resolve can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com

              See also --connect-to and --alt-svc.

       --retry-all-errors
              Retry on any error. This option is used together with --retry.

              This option is the "sledgehammer" of retrying. Do not  use  this
              option by default (eg in curlrc), there may be unintended conse-
              quences such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not  use
              with  redirected  input or output. You'd be much better off han-
              dling your unique problems in shell script. Please read the  ex-
              ample below.

              WARNING:  For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed
              flaky transfers as close as possible to how they  were  started,
              but  this  is  not possible with redirected input or output. For
              example, before retrying it removes output data  from  a  failed
              partial  transfer  that  was  written to an output file. However
              this is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or > file, which
              are  not  reset.  We strongly suggest you do not parse or record
              output via redirect in combination with this option,  since  you
              may receive duplicate data.

              By default curl will not error on an HTTP response code that in-
              dicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was successful. For exam-
              ple,  if  a  server replies 404 Not Found and the reply is fully
              received then that is not an error. When --retry  is  used  then
              curl  will retry on some HTTP response codes that indicate tran-
              sient HTTP errors, but that does not include most  4xx  response
              codes  such  as  404. If you want to retry on all response codes
              that indicate HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) then  combine  with  -f,
              --fail.

              Providing --retry-all-errors multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-retry-all-errors.

              Example:
               curl --retry 5 --retry-all-errors https://example.com

              See also --retry. Added in 7.71.0.

       --retry-connrefused
              In addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as  a
              transient  error  too  for --retry. This option is used together
              with --retry.

              Providing --retry-connrefused multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-retry-connrefused.

              Example:
               curl --retry-connrefused --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry and --retry-all-errors. Added in 7.52.0.

       --retry-delay <seconds>
              Make  curl  sleep  this  amount of time before each retry when a
              transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes  the  de-
              fault  backoff  time  algorithm between retries). This option is
              only interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay  to
              zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

              If  --retry-delay  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --retry-delay 5 --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry.

       --retry-max-time <seconds>
              The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt.  Re-
              tries  will  be done as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer
              has not reached this given limit. Notice that if the  timer  has
              not  reached  the limit, the request will be made and while per-
              forming, it may take longer than  this  given  time  period.  To
              limit  a  single request's maximum time, use -m, --max-time. Set
              this option to zero to not timeout retries.

              If --retry-max-time is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --retry-max-time 30 --retry 10 https://example.com

              See also --retry.

       --retry <num>
              If  a  transient  error is returned when curl tries to perform a
              transfer, it will retry this number of times before  giving  up.
              Setting  the  number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the
              default). Transient error means either: a timeout,  an  FTP  4xx
              response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response
              code.

              When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first  wait  one
              second  and  then for all forthcoming retries it will double the
              waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be  the
              delay  between  the  rest of the retries. By using --retry-delay
              you  disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See   also
              --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.

              Since  curl  7.66.0,  curl will comply with the Retry-After: re-
              sponse header if one was present to know when to issue the  next
              retry.

              If --retry is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry-max-time.

       --sasl-authzid <identity>
              Use this authorization identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN au-
              thentication,  in addition to the authentication identity (auth-
              cid) as specified by -u, --user.

              If the option is not specified, the server will derive  the  au-
              thzid  from  the authcid, but if specified, and depending on the
              server implementation, it may be used to access  another  user's
              inbox,  that  the  user  has been granted access to, or a shared
              mailbox for example.

              If --sasl-authzid is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --sasl-authzid zid imap://example.com/

              See also --login-options. Added in 7.66.0.

       --sasl-ir
              Enable initial response in SASL authentication.

              Providing --sasl-ir multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-sasl-ir.

              Example:
               curl --sasl-ir imap://example.com/

              See also --sasl-authzid. Added in 7.31.0.

       --service-name <name>
              This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

              Examples:   --negotiate   --service-name   sockd    would    use
              sockd/server-name.

              If  --service-name is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --service-name sockd/server https://example.com

              See also --negotiate and --proxy-service-name. Added in 7.43.0.

       -S, --show-error
              When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message
              if it fails.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -S, --show-error multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-show-error.

              Example:
               curl --show-error --silent https://example.com

              See also --no-progress-meter.

       -s, --silent
              Silent  or  quiet mode. Do not show progress meter or error mes-
              sages. Makes Curl mute. It will still output the  data  you  ask
              for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect
              it.

              Use -S, --show-error in  addition  to  this  option  to  disable
              progress meter but still show error messages.

              Providing -s, --silent multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-silent.

              Example:
               curl -s https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose, --stderr and --no-progress-meter.

       --socks4 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
              fied,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. Using this socket type make
              curl resolve the host name and passing the  address  on  to  the
              proxy.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix domain socket, use localhost for
              host, e.g.  socks4://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This  option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4 proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks4:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If  --socks4  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks4 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks4a, --socks5 and --socks5-hostname.

       --socks4a <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
              ified,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. This asks the proxy to re-
              solve the host name.

              To specify proxy on a unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for
              host, e.g.  socks4a://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4a proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks4a:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If --socks4a is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks4a hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks4, --socks5 and --socks5-hostname.

       --socks5-basic
              Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connect-
              ing to a SOCKS5 proxy.  The username/password authentication  is
              enabled  by  default.   Use --socks5-gssapi to force GSS-API au-
              thentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing --socks5-basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-basic --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5-gssapi-nec
              As part of the GSS-API negotiation a protection mode is  negoti-
              ated.  RFC  1961 says in section 4.3/4.4 it should be protected,
              but the  NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.  The  option
              --socks5-gssapi-nec  allows the unprotected exchange of the pro-
              tection mode negotiation.

              Providing --socks5-gssapi-nec multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-socks5-gssapi-nec.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi-nec --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5.

       --socks5-gssapi-service <name>
              The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
              This option allows you to change it.

              Examples:  --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service   sockd
              would  use sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name --socks5-gssapi-
              service sockd/real-name  would  use  sockd/real-name  for  cases
              where the proxy-name does not match the principal name.

              If  --socks5-gssapi-service  is provided several times, the last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi-service sockd --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5.

       --socks5-gssapi
              Tells curl to use GSS-API authentication when  connecting  to  a
              SOCKS5  proxy.  The GSS-API authentication is enabled by default
              (if curl is compiled with GSS-API support).  Use  --socks5-basic
              to force username/password authentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing  --socks5-gssapi  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-socks5-gssapi.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5-hostname <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the  proxy  resolve  the
              host  name).  If the port number is not specified, it is assumed
              at port 1080.

              To specify proxy on a unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for
              host, e.g.  socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5  host-
              name proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5h:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If --socks5-hostname is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-hostname proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

              See also --socks5 and --socks4a.

       --socks5 <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host name lo-
              cally. If the port number is not specified,  it  is  assumed  at
              port 1080.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix domain socket, use localhost for
              host, e.g.  socks5://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This  option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5 proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks5:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              This  option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS
              or LDAP.

              If --socks5 is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5 proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

              See also --socks5-hostname and --socks4a.

       -Y, --speed-limit <speed>
              If a transfer is slower than this given speed (in bytes per sec-
              ond) for speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time  is  set
              with -y, --speed-time and is 30 if not set.

              If  -Y,  --speed-limit  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

              See also -y, --speed-time, --limit-rate and -m, --max-time.

       -y, --speed-time <seconds>
              If a transfer runs slower than speed-limit bytes per second dur-
              ing  a speed-time period, the transfer is aborted. If speed-time
              is used, the default speed-limit will be 1 unless set  with  -Y,
              --speed-limit.

              This option controls transfers (in both directions) but will not
              affect slow connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try  the
              --connect-timeout option.

              If  -y,  --speed-time  is  provided  several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

              See also -Y, --speed-limit and --limit-rate.

       --ssl-allow-beast
              This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
              SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option is not
              used, the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause  interop-
              erability problems with some older SSL implementations.

              WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this
              flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing --ssl-allow-beast multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ssl-allow-beast.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-allow-beast https://example.com

              See also --proxy-ssl-allow-beast and -k, --insecure.

       --ssl-auto-client-cert
              Tell  libcurl  to automatically locate and use a client certifi-
              cate for authentication, when requested by the server. This  op-
              tion  is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL li-
              brary). Prior to 7.77.0 this was the default behavior in libcurl
              with Schannel. Since the server can request any certificate that
              supports client authentication in the OS  certificate  store  it
              could be a privacy violation and unexpected.

              Providing --ssl-auto-client-cert multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-ssl-auto-client-cert.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-auto-client-cert https://example.com

              See also --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert. Added in 7.77.0.

       --ssl-no-revoke
              (Schannel) This option tells curl to disable certificate revoca-
              tion checks.  WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and
              by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing --ssl-no-revoke multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ssl-no-revoke.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-no-revoke https://example.com

              See also --crlfile. Added in 7.44.0.

       --ssl-reqd
              (FTP  IMAP  POP3  SMTP LDAP) Require SSL/TLS for the connection.
              Terminates the connection if the transfer cannot be upgraded  to
              use SSL/TLS.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully
              supported by the OpenLDAP backend and rejected  by  the  generic
              ldap backend if explicit TLS is required.

              This  option  is unnecessary if you use a URL scheme that in it-
              self implies immediate and implicit use of TLS, like  for  FTPS,
              IMAPS,  POP3S,  SMTPS and LDAPS. Such transfers will always fail
              if the TLS handshake does not work.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl-reqd.

              Providing --ssl-reqd multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-ssl-reqd.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-reqd ftp://example.com

              See also --ssl and -k, --insecure.

       --ssl-revoke-best-effort
              (Schannel)  This option tells curl to ignore certificate revoca-
              tion checks when they failed due to missing/offline distribution
              points for the revocation check lists.

              Providing  --ssl-revoke-best-effort  multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ssl-revoke-best-effort.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-revoke-best-effort https://example.com

              See also --crlfile and -k, --insecure. Added in 7.70.0.

       --ssl  (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP LDAP) Warning: this is considered  an  inse-
              cure  option.  Consider using --ssl-reqd instead to be sure curl
              upgrades to a secure connection.

              Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection. Reverts to  a  non-secure
              connection  if  the  server  does  not support SSL/TLS. See also
              --ftp-ssl-control and --ssl-reqd for different levels of encryp-
              tion required.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully
              supported by the OpenLDAP backend and  ignored  by  the  generic
              ldap backend.

              Please  note that a server may close the connection if the nego-
              tiation does not succeed.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl.  That  option  name
              can still be used but will be removed in a future version.

              Providing  --ssl multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it
              again with --no-ssl.

              Example:
               curl --ssl pop3://example.com/

              See also --ssl-reqd, -k, --insecure and --ciphers.

       -2, --sslv2
              (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv2, but start-
              ing  in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv2 is widely
              considered insecure (see RFC 6176).

              Providing -2, --sslv2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --sslv2 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. -2, --sslv2  requires  that  the
              underlying  libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mu-
              tually exclusive to -3, --sslv3 and -1,  --tlsv1  and  --tlsv1.1
              and --tlsv1.2.

       -3, --sslv3
              (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv3, but start-
              ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv3 is  widely
              considered insecure (see RFC 7568).

              Providing -3, --sslv3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --sslv3 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -3, --sslv3 requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is  mu-
              tually  exclusive  to  -2, --sslv2 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1
              and --tlsv1.2.

       --stderr <file>
              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead.  If
              the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --stderr is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --stderr output.txt https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent.

       --styled-output
              Enables  the automatic use of bold font styles when writing HTTP
              headers to the terminal. Use --no-styled-output to  switch  them
              off.

              Styled output requires a terminal that supports bold fonts. This
              feature is not present on curl for Windows due to lack  of  this
              capability.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing --styled-output multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-styled-output.

              Example:
               curl --styled-output -I https://example.com

              See also -I, --head and -v, --verbose. Added in 7.61.0.

       --suppress-connect-headers
              When  -p, --proxytunnel is used and a CONNECT request is made do
              not output proxy CONNECT response headers. This option is  meant
              to  be  used  with  -D, --dump-header or -i, --include which are
              used to show protocol headers in the output. It has no effect on
              debug  options  such as -v, --verbose or --trace, or any statis-
              tics.

              Providing --suppress-connect-headers multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-suppress-connect-headers.

              Example:
               curl --suppress-connect-headers --include -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -D, --dump-header, -i, --include and -p, --proxytunnel.
              Added in 7.54.0.

       --tcp-fastopen
              Enable use of TCP Fast Open (RFC7413).

              Providing --tcp-fastopen multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tcp-fastopen.

              Example:
               curl --tcp-fastopen https://example.com

              See also --false-start. Added in 7.49.0.

       --tcp-nodelay
              Turn  on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3) man
              page for details about this option.

              Since 7.50.2, curl sets this option by default and you  need  to
              explicitly switch it off if you do not want it on.

              Providing  --tcp-nodelay  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tcp-nodelay.

              Example:
               curl --tcp-nodelay https://example.com

              See also -N, --no-buffer.

       -t, --telnet-option <opt=val>
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=<term> Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.

              -t, --telnet-option can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl -t TTYPE=vt100 telnet://example.com/

              See also -K, --config.

       --tftp-blksize <value>
              (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be >512). This is the block
              size that curl will try to use when transferring data to or from
              a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

              If --tftp-blksize is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tftp-blksize 1024 tftp://example.com/file

              See also --tftp-no-options.

       --tftp-no-options
              (TFTP) Tells curl not to send TFTP options requests.

              This  option  improves  interop with some legacy servers that do
              not acknowledge or properly implement TFTP  options.  When  this
              option is used --tftp-blksize is ignored.

              Providing  --tftp-no-options multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tftp-no-options.

              Example:
               curl --tftp-no-options tftp://192.168.0.1/

              See also --tftp-blksize. Added in 7.48.0.

       -z, --time-cond <time>
              (HTTP FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than  the
              given  time  and date, or one that has been modified before that
              time. The <date expression> can be all sorts of date strings  or
              if  it  does not match any internal ones, it is taken as a file-
              name and tries to get the modification date (mtime) from  <file>
              instead.  See  the curl_getdate(3) man pages for date expression
              details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
              a  document that is older than the given date/time, default is a
              document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If -z, --time-cond is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -z "Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl -z "-Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl -z file https://example.com

              See also --etag-compare and -R, --remote-time.

       --tls-max <VERSION>
              (SSL) VERSION defines maximum supported TLS version. The minimum
              acceptable version  is  set  by  tlsv1.0,  tlsv1.1,  tlsv1.2  or
              tlsv1.3.

              If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
              fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

              default
                     Use up to recommended TLS version.

              1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.

              1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.

              1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.

              1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

       If --tls-max is provided several times, the  last  set  value  will  be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl --tls-max 1.2 https://example.com
        curl --tls-max 1.3 --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

       See  also  --tlsv1.0, --tlsv1.1, --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3. --tls-max re-
       quires that the underlying libcurl was built to support TLS.  Added  in
       7.54.0.

       --tls13-ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS)  Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection if
              it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers suites  must  specify
              valid  ciphers.  Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher suite details on this
              URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl  is  built  to  use
              OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
              you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --ciphers
              option.

              If --tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 https://example.com

              See also --ciphers and --curves. Added in 7.61.0.

       --tlsauthtype <type>
              Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only  supported  op-
              tion  is  "SRP",  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If  --tlsuser  and
              --tlspassword are specified but --tlsauthtype is not, then  this
              option defaults to "SRP". This option works only if the underly-
              ing libcurl  is  built  with  TLS-SRP  support,  which  requires
              OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS-SRP support.

              If  --tlsauthtype  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlsauthtype SRP https://example.com

              See also --tlsuser.

       --tlspassword <string>
              Set password for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
              fied with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlsuser also be set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If  --tlspassword  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also --tlsuser.

       --tlsuser <name>
              Set username for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
              fied  with  --tlsauthtype.  Requires  that --tlspassword also is
              set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If --tlsuser is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also --tlspassword.

       --tlsv1.0
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this  option  was  documented  to  allow
              _only_ TLS 1.0.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.0 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.1
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this  option  was  documented  to  allow
              _only_ TLS 1.1.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.1 multiple times has no extra effect.

               curl --tlsv1.1 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3 and --tls-max. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.2
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this  option  was  documented  to  allow
              _only_ TLS 1.2.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3 and --tls-max. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.3
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              If the connection is done without TLS, this option  has  no  ef-
              fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

              Note that TLS 1.3 is not supported by all TLS backends.

              Providing --tlsv1.3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.3 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.2 and --tls-max. Added in 7.52.0.

       -1, --tlsv1
              (SSL)  Tells curl to use at least TLS version 1.x when negotiat-
              ing with a remote TLS server. That  means  TLS  version  1.0  or
              higher

              Providing -1, --tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -1, --tlsv1 requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is  mu-
              tually exclusive to --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.

       --tr-encoding
              (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one
              of the algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the  data  while
              receiving it.

              Providing  --tr-encoding  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tr-encoding.

              Example:
               curl --tr-encoding https://example.com

              See also --compressed.

       --trace-ascii <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
              cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and only
              shows  the  ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output that
              might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If  --trace-ascii  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --trace-ascii log.txt https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and --trace. This option is mutually  ex-
              clusive to --trace and -v, --verbose.

       --trace-time
              Prepends  a  time  stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl
              displays.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing --trace-time multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-trace-time.

              Example:
               curl --trace-time --trace-ascii output https://example.com

              See also --trace and -v, --verbose.

       --trace <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
              cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.  Use  "%"  as
              filename to have the output sent to stderr.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --trace is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --trace log.txt https://example.com

              See also --trace-ascii and --trace-time. This option is mutually
              exclusive to -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

       --unix-socket <path>
              (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using
              the network.

              If  --unix-socket  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --unix-socket socket-path https://example.com

              See also --abstract-unix-socket. Added in 7.40.0.

       -T, --upload-file <file>
              This transfers the specified local file to the  remote  URL.  If
              there is no file part in the specified URL, curl will append the
              local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
              directory  to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or
              curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
              name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
              fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will
              be used.

              Use  the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a
              given file.  Alternately, the file name "."  (a  single  period)
              may  be  specified  instead  of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking
              mode to allow reading server output while  stdin  is  being  up-
              loaded.

              You  can  specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on the com-
              mand line. Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies  what  to
              upload  and  to  where. curl also supports "globbing" of the -T,
              --upload-file argument, meaning that  you  can  upload  multiple
              files  to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style sup-
              ported in the URL.

              When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data  is  assumed
              to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of
              headers and mail body formatted correctly by the  user  as  curl
              will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.

              -T, --upload-file can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -T file https://example.com
               curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.example.com/
               curl --upload-file "{file1,file2}" https://example.com

              See also -G, --get and -I, --head.

       --url-query <data>
              (all)  This  option adds a piece of data, usually a name + value
              pair, to the end of the URL query part. The syntax is  identical
              to that used for --data-urlencode with one extension:

              If the argument starts with a '+' (plus), the rest of the string
              is provided as-is unencoded.

              The query part of a URL is the one following the  question  mark
              on the right end.

              --url-query can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --url-query name=val https://example.com
               curl --url-query =encodethis http://example.net/foo
               curl --url-query name@file https://example.com
               curl --url-query @fileonly https://example.com
               curl --url-query "+name=%20foo" https://example.com

              See also --data-urlencode and -G, --get. Added in 7.87.0.

       --url <url>
              Specify  a  URL  to  fetch. This option is mostly handy when you
              want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

              If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as "http://"  or
              "ftp://"  etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host. If
              the outermost sub-domain name matches  DICT,  FTP,  IMAP,  LDAP,
              POP3  or  SMTP  then  that protocol will be used, otherwise HTTP
              will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
              default protocol, see --proto-default for details.

              To  control  where  this URL is written, use the -o, --output or
              the -O, --remote-name options.

              WARNING: On Windows, particular file://  accesses  can  be  con-
              verted to network accesses by the operating system. Beware!

              --url can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --url https://example.com

              See also -:, --next and -K, --config.

       -B, --use-ascii
              (FTP  LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be en-
              forced by using a URL that  ends  with  ";type=A".  This  option
              causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

              Providing  -B,  --use-ascii  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-use-ascii.

              Example:
               curl -B ftp://example.com/README

              See also --crlf and --data-ascii.

       -A, --user-agent <name>
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
              To  encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
              quote marks. This header can also be set with the  -H,  --header
              or the --proxy-header options.

              If  you give an empty argument to -A, --user-agent (""), it will
              remove the header completely from the request. If you  prefer  a
              blank header, you can set it to a single space (" ").

              If  -A,  --user-agent  is  provided  several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl -A "Agent 007" https://example.com

              See also -H, --header and --proxy-header.

       -u, --user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-
              tion. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.

              If  you  simply  specify  the  user name, curl will prompt for a
              password.

              The user name and passwords are split up  on  the  first  colon,
              which  makes  it impossible to use a colon in the user name with
              this option. The password can, still.

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
              ment  from  process listings. This is not enough to protect cre-
              dentials from possibly getting seen by other users on  the  same
              system  as  they  will  still  be  visible  for  a moment before
              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.

              When  using  Kerberos  V5 with a Windows based server you should
              include the Windows domain name in the user name, in  order  for
              the  server  to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you do
              not, then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

              When using NTLM, the user name can be specified  simply  as  the
              user  name,  without the domain, if there is a single domain and
              forest in your setup for example.

              To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon  Name  or
              UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
              user@example.com respectively.

              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and  perform  Ker-
              beros  V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you can
              tell curl to select the user name and password from  your  envi-
              ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: "-u :".

              If -u, --user is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl -u user:secret https://example.com

              See also -n, --netrc and -K, --config.

       -v, --verbose
              Makes curl verbose during the operation.  Useful  for  debugging
              and  seeing  what's  going  on "under the hood". A line starting
              with '>' means "header data" sent by  curl,  '<'  means  "header
              data"  received  by  curl  that is hidden in normal cases, and a
              line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might
              be the option you are looking for.

              If you think this option still does not give you enough details,
              consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Use -s, --silent to make curl really quiet.

              Providing  -v,  --verbose  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-verbose.

              Example:
               curl --verbose https://example.com

              See also -i, --include. This option  is  mutually  exclusive  to
              --trace and --trace-ascii.

       -V, --version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

              The  first  line  includes the full version of curl, libcurl and
              other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

              The second line (starts with "Protocols:") shows  all  protocols
              that libcurl reports to support.

              The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features
              libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

              alt-svc
                     Support for the Alt-Svc: header is provided.

              AsynchDNS
                     This curl uses asynchronous name  resolves.  Asynchronous
                     name  resolves can be done using either the c-ares or the
                     threaded resolver backends.

       See also -h, --help and -M, --manual.

       -w, --write-out <format>
              Make curl display information on stdout after a completed trans-
              fer. The format is a string that may contain  plain  text  mixed
              with  any  number of variables. The format can be specified as a
              literal "string", or you can have curl read the  format  from  a
              file  with  "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format from
              stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will  be  substituted
              by  the  value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below.
              All variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output  a
              normal  % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline by
              using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

              The output will be written to standard output, but this  can  be
              switched to standard error by using %{stderr}.

              Output  HTTP  headers  from  the  most  recent  request by using
              %header{name} where name is the case  insensitive  name  of  the
              header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are ex-
              actly as sent over the network, with leading and trailing white-
              space trimmed. Added in curl 7.84.0.

              NOTE: In Windows the %-symbol is a special symbol used to expand
              environment variables. In batch files all occurrences of %  must
              be  doubled  when  using this option to properly escape. If this
              option is used at the command prompt then the %  cannot  be  es-
              caped and unintended expansion is possible.

              The variables available are:

              certs          Output  the  certificate chain with details. Sup-
                             ported only by  the  OpenSSL,  GnuTLS,  Schannel,
                             NSS,  GSKit  and Secure Transport backends (Added
                             in 7.88.0)

              content_type   The Content-Type of the  requested  document,  if
                             there was any.

              exitcode       The numerical exitcode of the transfer. (Added in
                             7.75.0)

              filename_effective
                             The ultimate filename that curl  writes  out  to.
                             This  is only meaningful if curl is told to write
                             to a file  with  the  -O,  --remote-name  or  -o,
                             --output  option. It's most useful in combination
                             with the -J, --remote-header-name option.

              ftp_entry_path The initial path curl ended up in when logging on
                             to the remote FTP server.

              header_json    A JSON object with all HTTP response headers from
                             the recent transfer. Values are provided  as  ar-
                             rays, since in the case of multiple headers there
                             can be multiple values. (Added in 7.83.0)

                             The header names provided in lowercase, listed in
                             order of appearance over the wire. Except for du-
                             plicated headers. They are grouped on  the  first
                             occurrence  of  that  header,  each value is pre-
                             sented in the JSON array.

              http_code      The numerical response code that was found in the
                             last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer.

              http_connect   The numerical code that was found in the last re-
                             sponse (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.

              http_version   The  http  version  that  was  effectively  used.
                             (Added in 7.50.0)

              json           A JSON object with all available keys.

              local_ip       The  IP  address of the local end of the most re-
                             cently done connection - can be  either  IPv4  or
                             IPv6.

              local_port     The  local  port number of the most recently done
                             connection.

              method         The http method used in the most recent HTTP  re-
                             quest. (Added in 7.72.0)

              num_certs      Number of server certificates received in the TLS
                             handshake. Supported only by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS,
                             Schannel,  NSS,  GSKit and Secure Transport back-
                             ends (Added in 7.88.0)

              num_connects   Number of new connects made in the recent  trans-
                             fer.

              num_headers    The number of response headers in the most recent
                             request (restarted at each redirect).  Note  that
                             the  status  line  IS  NOT  a  header.  (Added in
                             7.73.0)

              num_redirects  Number of redirects that were followed in the re-

              onerror        The  rest  of  the  output  is  only shown if the
                             transfer returned  a  non-zero  error  (Added  in
                             7.75.0)

              proxy_ssl_verify_result

                             tion to follow redirects (or when --max-redirs is
                             met),  this  variable  will show the actual URL a
                             redirect would have gone to.

              referer        The Referer: header, if there was any. (Added  in
                             7.76.0)

              remote_ip      The  remote  IP address of the most recently done

              scheme         The URL scheme (sometimes called  protocol)  that
                             was effectively used. (Added in 7.52.0)

              size_download  The  total  amount of bytes that were downloaded.
                             This is the size of the body/data that was trans-
                             ferred, excluding headers.

              size_header    The total amount of bytes of the downloaded head-
                             ers.

              size_request   The total amount of bytes that were sent  in  the
                             HTTP request.

              size_upload    The  total  amount  of  bytes that were uploaded.
                             This is the size of the body/data that was trans-
                             ferred, excluding headers.

              speed_download The average download speed that curl measured for
                             the complete download. Bytes per second.

              speed_upload   The average upload speed that curl  measured  for
                             the complete upload. Bytes per second.

              ssl_verify_result
                             The  result of the SSL peer certificate verifica-
                             tion that was requested. 0 means the verification
                             was successful.

              stderr         From  this  point  on, the -w, --write-out output
                             will be written  to  standard  error.  (Added  in
                             7.63.0)

              stdout         From  this  point  on, the -w, --write-out output
                             will be written to standard output.  This is  the
                             default,  but  can  be  used to switch back after
                             switching to stderr.  (Added in 7.63.0)

              time_appconnect
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til  the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the re-
                             mote host was completed.

              time_connect   The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy)
                             was completed.

              time_namelookup
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til the name resolving was completed.

              time_pretransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the file transfer was just  about  to  begin.
                             This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                             tiations that are specific to the particular pro-
                             tocol(s) involved.

              time_redirect  The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
                             steps including name lookup, connect, pretransfer
                             and  transfer  before  the  final transaction was
                             started. time_redirect shows the complete  execu-
                             tion time for multiple redirections.

              time_starttransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the first byte was just about  to  be  trans-
                             ferred.  This  includes time_pretransfer and also
                             the time the server needed to calculate  the  re-
                             sult.

              time_total     The  total time, in seconds, that the full opera-
                             tion lasted.

              url            The URL that was fetched. (Added in 7.75.0)

              urlnum         The URL index number of this transfer, 0-indexed.
                             De-globbed  URLs  share  the same index number as
                             the origin globbed URL. (Added in 7.75.0)

              url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most mean-
                             ingful  if you have told curl to follow location:
                             headers.

              If -w, --write-out is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl -w '%{http_code}\n' https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -I, --head.

       --xattr
              When  saving  output  to a file, this option tells curl to store
              certain file metadata in extended  file  attributes.  Currently,
              the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP,
              the content type is stored in the mime_type  attribute.  If  the
              file  system  does not support extended attributes, a warning is
              issued.

              Providing --xattr multiple times has no extra  effect.   Disable
              it again with --no-xattr.

              Example:
               curl --xattr -o storage https://example.com

              See also -R, --remote-time, -w, --write-out and -v, --verbose.

COMMAND: wget

DESCRIPTION: Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.

USAGE: wget [option]... [URL]...

OPTIONS:
Option Syntax
       Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
       option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more
       convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix
       different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
       arguments.  Thus you may write:

               wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log

       The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
       be omitted.  Instead of -o log you can write -olog.

       You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
       like:

               wget -drc <URL>

       This is completely equivalent to:

               wget -d -r -c <URL>

       Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
       terminate them with --.  So the following will try to download URL -x,
       reporting failure to log:

               wget -o log -- -x

       The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
       convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
       useful to clear the .wgetrc settings.  For instance, if your .wgetrc
       sets "exclude_directories" to /cgi-bin, the following example will
       first reset it, and then set it to exclude /~nobody and /~somebody.
       You can also clear the lists in .wgetrc.

               wget -X "" -X /~nobody,/~somebody

       Most options that do not accept arguments are boolean options, so named
       because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no ("boolean")
       variable.  For example, --follow-ftp tells Wget to follow FTP links
       from HTML files and, on the other hand, --no-glob tells it not to
       perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A boolean option is either
       affirmative or negative (beginning with --no).  All such options share
       several properties.

       Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is the
       opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the documented
       existence of --follow-ftp assumes that the default is to not follow FTP
       links from HTML pages.

       Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the --no- to the
       option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the --no-
       prefix.  This might seem superfluous---if the default for an
       affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way to
       explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change the
       default.  For instance, using "follow_ftp = on" in .wgetrc makes Wget
       follow FTP links by default, and using --no-follow-ftp is the only way
       to restore the factory default from the command line.

   Basic Startup Options
       -V
       --version
           Display the version of Wget.

       -h
       --help
           Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.

       -b
       --background
           Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
           specified via the -o, output is redirected to wget-log.

       -e command
       --execute command
           Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc.  A command thus
           invoked will be executed after the commands in .wgetrc, thus taking
           precedence over them.  If you need to specify more than one wgetrc
           command, use multiple instances of -e.

   Logging and Input File Options
       -o logfile
       --output-file=logfile
           Log all messages to logfile.  The messages are normally reported to
           standard error.

       -a logfile
       --append-output=logfile
           Append to logfile.  This is the same as -o, only it appends to
           logfile instead of overwriting the old log file.  If logfile does
           not exist, a new file is created.

       -d
       --debug
           Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
           developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
           administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
           support, in which case -d will not work.  Please note that
           compiling with debug support is always safe---Wget compiled with
           the debug support will not print any debug info unless requested
           with -d.

       -q
       --quiet
           Turn off Wget's output.

       -v
       --verbose
           Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
           output is verbose.

       -nv
       --no-verbose
           Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use -q for that),
           which means that error messages and basic information still get
           printed.

       --report-speed=type
           Output bandwidth as type.  The only accepted value is bits.

       -i file
       --input-file=file
           Read URLs from a local or external file.  If - is specified as
           file, URLs are read from the standard input.  (Use ./- to read from
           a file literally named -.)

           If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command
           line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input
           file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to be
           retrieved.  If --force-html is not specified, then file should
           consist of a series of URLs, one per line.

           However, if you specify --force-html, the document will be regarded
           as html.  In that case you may have problems with relative links,
           which you can solve either by adding "<base href="url">" to the
           documents or by specifying --base=url on the command line.

           If the file is an external one, the document will be automatically
           treated as html if the Content-Type matches text/html.
           Furthermore, the file's location will be implicitly used as base
           href if none was specified.

       --input-metalink=file
           Downloads files covered in local Metalink file. Metalink version 3
           and 4 are supported.

       --keep-badhash
           Keeps downloaded Metalink's files with a bad hash. It appends
           .badhash to the name of Metalink's files which have a checksum
           mismatch, except without overwriting existing files.

       --metalink-over-http
           Issues HTTP HEAD request instead of GET and extracts Metalink
           metadata from response headers. Then it switches to Metalink
           download.  If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls back to
           ordinary HTTP download.  Enables Content-Type:
           application/metalink4+xml files download/processing.

       --metalink-index=number
           Set the Metalink application/metalink4+xml metaurl ordinal NUMBER.
           From 1 to the total number of "application/metalink4+xml"
           available.  Specify 0 or inf to choose the first good one.
           Metaurls, such as those from a --metalink-over-http, may have been
           sorted by priority key's value; keep this in mind to choose the
           right NUMBER.

       --preferred-location
           Set preferred location for Metalink resources. This has effect if
           multiple resources with same priority are available.

       --xattr
           Enable use of file system's extended attributes to save the
           original URL and the Referer HTTP header value if used.

           Be aware that the URL might contain private information like access
           tokens or credentials.

       -F
       --force-html
           When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
           file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
           HTML files on your local disk, by adding "<base href="url">" to
           HTML, or using the --base command-line option.

       -B URL
       --base=URL
           Resolves relative links using URL as the point of reference, when
           reading links from an HTML file specified via the -i/--input-file
           option (together with --force-html, or when the input file was
           fetched remotely from a server describing it as HTML). This is
           equivalent to the presence of a "BASE" tag in the HTML input file,
           with URL as the value for the "href" attribute.

           For instance, if you specify http://foo/bar/a.html for URL, and
           Wget reads ../baz/b.html from the input file, it would be resolved
           to http://foo/baz/b.html.

       --config=FILE
           Specify the location of a startup file you wish to use instead of
           the default one(s). Use --no-config to disable reading of config
           files.  If both --config and --no-config are given, --no-config is
           ignored.

       --rejected-log=logfile
           Logs all URL rejections to logfile as comma separated values.  The
           values include the reason of rejection, the URL and the parent URL
           it was found in.

   Download Options
       --bind-address=ADDRESS
           When making client TCP/IP connections, bind to ADDRESS on the local
           machine.  ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or IP address.
           This option can be useful if your machine is bound to multiple IPs.

       --bind-dns-address=ADDRESS
           [libcares only] This address overrides the route for DNS requests.
           If you ever need to circumvent the standard settings from
           /etc/resolv.conf, this option together with --dns-servers is your
           friend.  ADDRESS must be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 address.
           Wget needs to be built with libcares for this option to be
           available.

       --dns-servers=ADDRESSES
           [libcares only] The given address(es) override the standard
           nameserver addresses,  e.g. as configured in /etc/resolv.conf.
           ADDRESSES may be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, comma-
           separated.  Wget needs to be built with libcares for this option to
           be available.

       -t number
       --tries=number
           Set number of tries to number. Specify 0 or inf for infinite
           retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception of
           fatal errors like "connection refused" or "not found" (404), which
           are not retried.

       -O file
       --output-document=file
           The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
           will be concatenated together and written to file.  If - is used as
           file, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link
           conversion.  (Use ./- to print to a file literally named -.)

           Use of -O is not intended to mean simply "use the name file instead
           of the one in the URL;" rather, it is analogous to shell
           redirection: wget -O file http://foo is intended to work like wget
           -O - http://foo > file; file will be truncated immediately, and all
           downloaded content will be written there.

           For this reason, -N (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in
           combination with -O: since file is always newly created, it will
           always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this
           combination is used.

           Similarly, using -r or -p with -O may not work as you expect: Wget
           won't just download the first file to file and then download the
           rest to their normal names: all downloaded content will be placed
           in file. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been reinstated
           (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where this
           behavior can actually have some use.

           A combination with -nc is only accepted if the given output file
           does not exist.

           Note that a combination with -k is only permitted when downloading
           a single document, as in that case it will just convert all
           relative URIs to external ones; -k makes no sense for multiple URIs
           when they're all being downloaded to a single file; -k can be used
           only when the output is a regular file.

       -nc
       --no-clobber
           If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
           Wget's behavior depends on a few options, including -nc.  In
           certain cases, the local file will be clobbered, or overwritten,
           upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.

           When running Wget without -N, -nc, -r, or -p, downloading the same
           file in the same directory will result in the original copy of file
           being preserved and the second copy being named file.1.  If that
           file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named file.2,
           and so on.  (This is also the behavior with -nd, even if -r or -p
           are in effect.)  When -nc is specified, this behavior is
           suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of file.
           Therefore, ""no-clobber"" is actually a misnomer in this
           mode---it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric
           suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the
           multiple version saving that's prevented.

           When running Wget with -r or -p, but without -N, -nd, or -nc, re-
           downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting
           the old.  Adding -nc will prevent this behavior, instead causing
           the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the
           server to be ignored.

           When running Wget with -N, with or without -r or -p, the decision
           as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on
           the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.  -nc may not
           be specified at the same time as -N.

           A combination with -O/--output-document is only accepted if the
           given output file does not exist.

           Note that when -nc is specified, files with the suffixes .html or
           .htm will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they had
           been retrieved from the Web.

       --backups=backups
           Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by adding a
           .1 suffix (_1 on VMS) to the file name.  Such backup files are
           rotated to .2, .3, and so on, up to backups (and lost beyond that).

       --no-netrc
           Do not try to obtain credentials from .netrc file. By default
           .netrc file is searched for credentials in case none have been
           passed on command line and authentication is required.

       -c
       --continue
           Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
           you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
           Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

                   wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

           If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget
           will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
           will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal
           to the length of the local file.

           Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want
           the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
           the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default
           behavior.  -c only affects resumption of downloads started prior to
           this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting
           around.

           Without -c, the previous example would just download the remote
           file to ls-lR.Z.1, leaving the truncated ls-lR.Z file alone.

           If you use -c on a non-empty file, and the server does not support
           continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from scratch
           and overwrite the existing file entirely.

           Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use -c on a file which is of equal
           size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
           file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the
           file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it
           was changed on the server since your last download
           attempt)---because "continuing" is not meaningful, no download
           occurs.

           On the other side of the coin, while using -c, any file that's
           bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
           download and only "(length(remote) - length(local))" bytes will be
           downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
           behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can
           use wget -c to download just the new portion that's been appended
           to a data collection or log file.

           However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
           changed, as opposed to just appended to, you'll end up with a
           garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
           really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
           especially careful of this when using -c in conjunction with -r,
           since every file will be considered as an "incomplete download"
           candidate.

           Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
           -c is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a "transfer
           interrupted" string into the local file.  In the future a
           "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.

           Note that -c only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers that
           support the "Range" header.

       --start-pos=OFFSET
           Start downloading at zero-based position OFFSET.  Offset may be
           expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the `k' suffix, or megabytes
           with the `m' suffix, etc.

           --start-pos has higher precedence over --continue.  When
           --start-pos and --continue are both specified, wget will emit a
           warning then proceed as if --continue was absent.

           Server support for continued download is required, otherwise
           --start-pos cannot help.  See -c for details.

       --progress=type
           Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
           indicators are "dot" and "bar".

           The "bar" indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII progress
           bar graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display) indicating the status of
           retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the "dot" bar will be used
           by default.

           Use --progress=dot to switch to the "dot" display.  It traces the
           retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
           fixed amount of downloaded data.

           The progress type can also take one or more parameters.  The
           parameters vary based on the type selected.  Parameters to type are
           passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon (:) like
           this: --progress=type:parameter1:parameter2.

           When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the style by
           specifying the type as dot:style.  Different styles assign
           different meaning to one dot.  With the "default" style each dot
           represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a
           line.  The "binary" style has a more "computer"-like
           orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which
           makes for 384K lines).  The "mega" style is suitable for
           downloading large files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there
           are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line
           contains 3M).  If "mega" is not enough then you can use the "giga"
           style---each dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a
           cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains 32M).

           With --progress=bar, there are currently two possible parameters,
           force and noscroll.

           When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls back to
           "dot", even if --progress=bar was passed to Wget during invocation.
           This behaviour can be overridden and the "bar" output forced by
           using the "force" parameter as --progress=bar:force.

           By default, the bar style progress bar scroll the name of the file
           from left to right for the file being downloaded if the filename
           exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.  In certain
           cases, such as with --progress=bar:force, one may not want the
           scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By passing the "noscroll"
           parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the filename as
           possible without scrolling through it.

           Note that you can set the default style using the "progress"
           command in .wgetrc.  That setting may be overridden from the
           command line.  For example, to force the bar output without
           scrolling, use --progress=bar:force:noscroll.

       --show-progress
           Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.

           By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose mode.
           One may however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen in
           conjunction with any other verbosity modes like --no-verbose or
           --quiet.  This is often a desired a property when invoking wget to
           download several small/large files.  In such a case, wget could
           simply be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output
           on the screen.

           This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
           stderr when used alongside the --output-file option.

       -N
       --timestamping
           Turn on time-stamping.

       --no-if-modified-since
           Do not send If-Modified-Since header in -N mode. Send preliminary
           HEAD request instead. This has only effect in -N mode.

       --no-use-server-timestamps
           Don't set the local file's timestamp by the one on the server.

           By default, when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set to
           match those from the remote file. This allows the use of
           --timestamping on subsequent invocations of wget. However, it is
           sometimes useful to base the local file's timestamp on when it was
           actually downloaded; for that purpose, the
           --no-use-server-timestamps option has been provided.

       -S
       --server-response
           Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
           servers.

       --spider
           When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web spider,
           which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
           they are there.  For example, you can use Wget to check your
           bookmarks:

                   wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

           This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
           functionality of real web spiders.

       -T seconds
       --timeout=seconds
           Set the network timeout to seconds seconds.  This is equivalent to
           specifying --dns-timeout, --connect-timeout, and --read-timeout,
           all at the same time.

           When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
           abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies
           like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled
           by default is a 900-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0
           disables it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is
           best not to change the default timeout settings.

           All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
           subsecond values.  For example, 0.1 seconds is a legal (though
           unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for
           checking server response times or for testing network latency.

       --dns-timeout=seconds
           Set the DNS lookup timeout to seconds seconds.  DNS lookups that
           don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By default,
           there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that implemented by
           system libraries.

       --connect-timeout=seconds
           Set the connect timeout to seconds seconds.  TCP connections that
           take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default, there is no
           connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.

       --read-timeout=seconds
           Set the read (and write) timeout to seconds seconds.  The "time" of
           this timeout refers to idle time: if, at any point in the download,
           no data is received for more than the specified number of seconds,
           reading fails and the download is restarted.  This option does not
           directly affect the duration of the entire download.

           Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection
           sooner than this option requires.  The default read timeout is 900
           seconds.

       --limit-rate=amount
           Limit the download speed to amount bytes per second.  Amount may be
           expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the k suffix, or megabytes with
           the m suffix.  For example, --limit-rate=20k will limit the
           retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
           reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available
           bandwidth.

           This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in
           conjunction with power suffixes; for example, --limit-rate=2.5k is
           a legal value.

           Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
           amount of time after a network read that took less time than
           specified by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the TCP
           transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate.
           However, it may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so
           don't be surprised if limiting the rate doesn't work well with very
           small files.

       -w seconds
       --wait=seconds
           Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
           of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
           making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time
           can be specified in minutes using the "m" suffix, in hours using
           "h" suffix, or in days using "d" suffix.

           Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
           or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
           to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
           retry.  The waiting interval specified by this function is
           influenced by "--random-wait", which see.

       --waitretry=seconds
           If you don't want Wget to wait between every retrieval, but only
           between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.  Wget
           will use linear backoff, waiting 1 second after the first failure
           on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on
           that file, up to the maximum number of seconds you specify.

           By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.

       --random-wait
           Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval
           programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant
           similarities in the time between requests. This option causes the
           time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * wait seconds,
           where wait was specified using the --wait option, in order to mask
           Wget's presence from such analysis.

           A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
           consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the
           fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to
           ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing
           DHCP-supplied addresses.

           The --random-wait option was inspired by this ill-advised
           recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to
           the actions of one.

       --no-proxy
           Don't use proxies, even if the appropriate *_proxy environment
           variable is defined.

       -Q quota
       --quota=quota
           Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
           specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with k suffix), or
           megabytes (with m suffix).

           Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if
           you specify wget -Q10k https://example.com/ls-lR.gz, all of the
           ls-lR.gz will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several URLs
           are specified on the command-line.  The quota is checked only at
           the end of each downloaded file, so it will never result in a
           partially downloaded file. Thus you may safely type wget -Q2m -i
           sites---download will be aborted after the file that exhausts the
           quota is completely downloaded.

           Setting quota to 0 or to inf unlimits the download quota.

       --no-dns-cache
           Turn off caching of DNS lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the IP
           addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to repeatedly
           contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set of hosts
           it retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget
           run will contact DNS again.

           However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
           desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a short-
           running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues a new
           DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to "gethostbyname" or
           "getaddrinfo") each time it makes a new connection.  Please note
           that this option will not affect caching that might be performed by
           the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such as
           NSCD.

           If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you probably
           won't need it.

       --restrict-file-names=modes
           Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during
           generation of local filenames.  Characters that are restricted by
           this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with %HH, where HH is the
           hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character.
           This option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be
           either lower- or uppercase.

           By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe
           as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control
           characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful
           for changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to
           a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of
           the control characters, or you want to further restrict characters
           to only those in the ASCII range of values.

           The modes are a comma-separated set of text values. The acceptable
           values are unix, windows, nocontrol, ascii, lowercase, and
           uppercase. The values unix and windows are mutually exclusive (one
           will override the other), as are lowercase and uppercase. Those
           last are special cases, as they do not change the set of characters
           that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to be
           converted either to lower- or uppercase.

           When "unix" is specified, Wget escapes the character / and the
           control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  This is the
           default on Unix-like operating systems.

           When "windows" is given, Wget escapes the characters \, |, /, :, ?,
           ", *, <, >, and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and
           128--159.  In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses + instead
           of : to separate host and port in local file names, and uses @
           instead of ? to separate the query portion of the file name from
           the rest.  Therefore, a URL that would be saved as
           www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah in Unix mode would be
           saved as www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah in Windows mode.
           This mode is the default on Windows.

           If you specify nocontrol, then the escaping of the control
           characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when
           you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8 characters, on a
           system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8 (some possible
           byte values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the range of
           values designated by Wget as "controls").

           The ascii mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are
           outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127)
           shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose
           encoding does not match the one used locally.

       -4
       --inet4-only
       -6
       --inet6-only
           Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With --inet4-only or
           -4, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA records in
           DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in URLs.
           Conversely, with --inet6-only or -6, Wget will only connect to IPv6
           hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.

           Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an
           IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the host's
           DNS record.  If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
           Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it can connect
           to.  (Also see "--prefer-family" option described below.)

           These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or
           IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid
           debugging or to deal with broken network configuration.  Only one
           of --inet6-only and --inet4-only may be specified at the same time.
           Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.

       --prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6
           When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
           with specified address family first.  The address order returned by
           DNS is used without change by default.

           This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing
           hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4
           networks.  For example, www.kame.net resolves to
           2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085 and to 203.178.141.194.  When
           the preferred family is "IPv4", the IPv4 address is used first;
           when the preferred family is "IPv6", the IPv6 address is used
           first; if the specified value is "none", the address order returned
           by DNS is used without change.

           Unlike -4 and -6, this option doesn't inhibit access to any address
           family, it only changes the order in which the addresses are
           accessed.  Also note that the reordering performed by this option
           is stable---it doesn't affect order of addresses of the same
           family.  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of
           all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.

       --retry-connrefused
           Consider "connection refused" a transient error and try again.
           Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect to the
           site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server
           is not running at all and that retries would not help.  This option
           is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear
           for short periods of time.

       --user=user
       --password=password
           Specify the username user and password password for both FTP and
           HTTP file retrieval.  These parameters can be overridden using the
           --ftp-user and --ftp-password options for FTP connections and the
           --http-user and --http-password options for HTTP connections.

       --ask-password
           Prompt for a password for each connection established. Cannot be
           specified when --password is being used, because they are mutually
           exclusive.

       --use-askpass=command
           Prompt for a user and password using the specified command.  If no
           command is specified then the command in the environment variable
           WGET_ASKPASS is used.  If WGET_ASKPASS is not set then the command
           in the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS is used.

           You can set the default command for use-askpass in the .wgetrc.
           That setting may be overridden from the command line.

       --no-iri
           Turn off internationalized URI (IRI) support. Use --iri to turn it
           on. IRI support is activated by default.

           You can set the default state of IRI support using the "iri"
           command in .wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command
           line.

       --local-encoding=encoding
           Force Wget to use encoding as the default system encoding. That
           affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments from locale
           to UTF-8 for IRI support.

           Wget use the function "nl_langinfo()" and then the "CHARSET"
           environment variable to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII is used.

           You can set the default local encoding using the "local_encoding"
           command in .wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command
           line.

       --remote-encoding=encoding
           Force Wget to use encoding as the default remote server encoding.
           That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files from remote
           encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch. This options is only
           useful for IRI support, for the interpretation of non-ASCII
           characters.

           For HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP "Content-Type"
           header and in HTML "Content-Type http-equiv" meta tag.

           You can set the default encoding using the "remoteencoding" command
           in .wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command line.

       --unlink
           Force Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing file. This
           option is useful for downloading to the directory with hardlinks.

   Directory Options
       -nd
       --no-directories
           Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
           recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get saved
           to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
           more than once, the filenames will get extensions .n).

       -x
       --force-directories
           The opposite of -nd---create a hierarchy of directories, even if
           one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. wget -x
           http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt will save the downloaded file to
           fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt.

       -nH
       --no-host-directories
           Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
           invoking Wget with -r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ will create a
           structure of directories beginning with fly.srk.fer.hr/.  This
           option disables such behavior.

       --protocol-directories
           Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names.
           For example, with this option, wget -r http://host will save to
           http/host/... rather than just to host/....

       --cut-dirs=number
           Ignore number directory components.  This is useful for getting a
           fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
           will be saved.

           Take, for example, the directory at
           ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/.  If you retrieve it with -r, it
           will be saved locally under ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/.  While the
           -nH option can remove the ftp.xemacs.org/ part, you are still stuck
           with pub/xemacs.  This is where --cut-dirs comes in handy; it makes
           Wget not "see" number remote directory components.  Here are
           several examples of how --cut-dirs option works.

                   No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
                   -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .

                   --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
                   ...

           If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option
           is similar to a combination of -nd and -P.  However, unlike -nd,
           --cut-dirs does not lose with subdirectories---for instance, with
           -nH --cut-dirs=1, a beta/ subdirectory will be placed to
           xemacs/beta, as one would expect.

       -P prefix
       --directory-prefix=prefix
           Set directory prefix to prefix.  The directory prefix is the
           directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
           to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is . (the
           current directory).

   HTTP Options
       --default-page=name
           Use name as the default file name when it isn't known (i.e., for
           URLs that end in a slash), instead of index.html.

       -E
       --adjust-extension
           If a file of type application/xhtml+xml or text/html is downloaded
           and the URL does not end with the regexp \.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?, this
           option will cause the suffix .html to be appended to the local
           filename.  This is useful, for instance, when you're mirroring a
           remote site that uses .asp pages, but you want the mirrored pages
           to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another good use for
           this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A URL
           like http://site.com/article.cgi?25 will be saved as
           article.cgi?25.html.

           Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every
           time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local
           X.html file corresponds to remote URL X (since it doesn't yet know
           that the URL produces output of type text/html or
           application/xhtml+xml.

           As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files
           of type text/css end in the suffix .css, and the option was renamed
           from --html-extension, to better reflect its new behavior. The old
           option name is still acceptable, but should now be considered
           deprecated.

           As of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded
           files with a "Content-Encoding" of br, compress, deflate or gzip
           end in the suffix .br, .Z, .zlib and .gz respectively.

           At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded to
           include suffixes for other types of content, including content
           types that are not parsed by Wget.

       --http-user=user
       --http-password=password
           Specify the username user and password password on an HTTP server.
           According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them using
           either the "basic" (insecure), the "digest", or the Windows "NTLM"
           authentication scheme.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself.
           Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run
           "ps".  To prevent the passwords from being seen, use the
           --use-askpass or store them in .wgetrc or .netrc, and make sure to
           protect those files from other users with "chmod".  If the
           passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in those
           files either---edit the files and delete them after Wget has
           started the download.

       --no-http-keep-alive
           Turn off the "keep-alive" feature for HTTP downloads.  Normally,
           Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you
           download more than one document from the same server, they get
           transferred over the same TCP connection.  This saves time and at
           the same time reduces the load on the server.

           This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-
           alive) connections don't work for you, for example due to a server
           bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the
           connections.

       --no-cache
           Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the remote
           server appropriate directives (Cache-Control: no-cache and Pragma:
           no-cache) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
           returning the cached version. This is especially useful for
           retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

           Caching is allowed by default.

       --no-cookies
           Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for
           maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a
           cookie using the "Set-Cookie" header, and the client responds with
           the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the
           server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange
           this information, some consider them a breach of privacy.  The
           default is to use cookies; however, storing cookies is not on by
           default.

       --load-cookies file
           Load cookies from file before the first HTTP retrieval.  file is a
           textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
           cookies.txt file.

           You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
           require that you be logged in to access some or all of their
           content.  The login process typically works by the web server
           issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
           credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when
           accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

           Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
           browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved
           by --load-cookies---simply point Wget to the location of the
           cookies.txt file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
           would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
           cookie files in different locations:

           "Netscape 4.x."
               The cookies are in ~/.netscape/cookies.txt.

           "Mozilla and Netscape 6.x."
               Mozilla's cookie file is also named cookies.txt, located
               somewhere under ~/.mozilla, in the directory of your profile.
               The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
               ~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt.

           "Internet Explorer."
               You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File
               menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been tested
               with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with
               earlier versions.

           "Other browsers."
               If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
               --load-cookies will only work if you can locate or produce a
               cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.

           If you cannot use --load-cookies, there might still be an
           alternative.  If your browser supports a "cookie manager", you can
           use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're
           mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the cookie, and
           manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
           "official" cookie support:

                   wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: <name>=<value>"

       --save-cookies file
           Save cookies to file before exiting.  This will not save cookies
           that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called "session
           cookies"), but also see --keep-session-cookies.

       --keep-session-cookies
           When specified, causes --save-cookies to also save session cookies.
           Session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be
           kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser.  Saving
           them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit the
           home page before you can access some pages.  With this option,
           multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far
           as the site is concerned.

           Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session
           cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget's
           --load-cookies recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
           confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
           treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want
           --save-cookies to preserve them again, you must use
           --keep-session-cookies again.

       --ignore-length
           Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more precise)
           send out bogus "Content-Length" headers, which makes Wget go wild,
           as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot this
           syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
           each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has
           closed on the very same byte.

           With this option, Wget will ignore the "Content-Length" header---as
           if it never existed.

       --header=header-line
           Send header-line along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP
           request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it must
           contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain
           newlines.

           You may define more than one additional header by specifying
           --header more than once.

                   wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
                        --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                          http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

           Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
           previous user-defined headers.

           As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers
           otherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to
           connect to localhost, but to specify foo.bar in the "Host" header:

                   wget --header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/

           In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of --header caused
           sending of duplicate headers.

       --compression=type
           Choose the type of compression to be used.  Legal values are auto,
           gzip and none.

           If auto or gzip are specified, Wget asks the server to compress the
           file using the gzip compression format. If the server compresses
           the file and responds with the "Content-Encoding" header field set
           appropriately, the file will be decompressed automatically.

           If none is specified, wget will not ask the server to compress the
           file and will not decompress any server responses. This is the
           default.

           Compression support is currently experimental. In case it is turned
           on, please report any bugs to "bug-wget@gnu.org".

       --max-redirect=number
           Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a
           resource.  The default is 20, which is usually far more than
           necessary. However, on those occasions where you want to allow more
           (or fewer), this is the option to use.

       --proxy-user=user
       --proxy-password=password
           Specify the username user and password password for authentication
           on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the "basic"
           authentication scheme.

           Security considerations similar to those with --http-password
           pertain here as well.

       --referer=url
           Include `Referer: url' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
           retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they
           are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only
           come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
           point to them.

       --save-headers
           Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
           actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.

       -U agent-string
       --user-agent=agent-string
           Identify as agent-string to the HTTP server.

           The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
           "User-Agent" header field.  This enables distinguishing the WWW
           software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
           protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as Wget/version,
           version being the current version number of Wget.

           However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
           tailoring the output according to the "User-Agent"-supplied
           information.  While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has
           been abused by servers denying information to clients other than
           (historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet
           Explorer.  This option allows you to change the "User-Agent" line
           issued by Wget.  Use of this option is discouraged, unless you
           really know what you are doing.

           Specifying empty user agent with --user-agent="" instructs Wget not
           to send the "User-Agent" header in HTTP requests.

       --post-data=string
       --post-file=file
           Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified
           data in the request body.  --post-data sends string as data,
           whereas --post-file sends the contents of file.  Other than that,
           they work in exactly the same way. In particular, they both expect
           content of the form "key1=value1&key2=value2", with percent-
           encoding for special characters; the only difference is that one
           expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other
           accepts its content from a file. In particular, --post-file is not
           for transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as
           "key=value" data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like
           everything else. Wget does not currently support
           "multipart/form-data" for transmitting POST data; only
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". Only one of --post-data and
           --post-file should be specified.

           Please note that wget does not require the content to be of the
           form "key1=value1&key2=value2", and neither does it test for it.
           Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to it. Most
           servers however expect the POST data to be in the above format when
           processing HTML Forms.

           When sending a POST request using the --post-file option, Wget
           treats the file as a binary file and will send every character in
           the POST request without stripping trailing newline or formfeed
           characters. Any other control characters in the text will also be
           sent as-is in the POST request.

           Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data
           in advance.  Therefore the argument to "--post-file" must be a
           regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like /dev/stdin won't
           work.  It's not quite clear how to work around this limitation
           inherent in HTTP/1.0.  Although HTTP/1.1 introduces chunked
           transfer that doesn't require knowing the request length in
           advance, a client can't use chunked unless it knows it's talking to
           an HTTP/1.1 server.  And it can't know that until it receives a
           response, which in turn requires the request to have been completed
           -- a chicken-and-egg problem.

           Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST
           request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the response
           code returned by the server.  In case of a 301 Moved Permanently,
           302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in
           accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a POST request.  In case
           a server wants the client to change the Request method upon
           redirection, it should send a 303 See Other response code.

           This example shows how to log in to a server using POST and then
           proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible
           to authorized users:

                   # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
                   wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
                        --post-data 'user=foo&password=bar' \
                        http://example.com/auth.php

                   # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
                   wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
                        -p http://example.com/interesting/article.php

           If the server is using session cookies to track user
           authentication, the above will not work because --save-cookies will
           not save them (and neither will browsers) and the cookies.txt file
           will be empty.  In that case use --keep-session-cookies along with
           --save-cookies to force saving of session cookies.

       --method=HTTP-Method
           For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of other
           HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly set them using
           --header=Header-Line.  Wget will use whatever string is passed to
           it after --method as the HTTP Method to the server.

       --body-data=Data-String
       --body-file=Data-File
           Must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the server
           along with the Method specified using --method.  --body-data sends
           string as data, whereas --body-file sends the contents of file.
           Other than that, they work in exactly the same way.

           Currently, --body-file is not for transmitting files as a whole.
           Wget does not currently support "multipart/form-data" for
           transmitting data; only "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". In the
           future, this may be changed so that wget sends the --body-file as a
           complete file instead of sending its contents to the server. Please
           be aware that Wget needs to know the contents of BODY Data in
           advance, and hence the argument to --body-file should be a regular
           file. See --post-file for a more detailed explanation.  Only one of
           --body-data and --body-file should be specified.

           If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget will
           suspend the current method and send a GET request till the
           redirection is completed.  This is true for all redirection
           response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which is used to
           explicitly specify that the request method should not change.
           Another exception is when the method is set to "POST", in which
           case the redirection rules specified under --post-data are
           followed.

       --content-disposition
           If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support
           for "Content-Disposition" headers is enabled. This can currently
           result in extra round-trips to the server for a "HEAD" request, and
           is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not
           currently enabled by default.

           This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that
           use "Content-Disposition" headers to describe what the name of a
           downloaded file should be.

           When combined with --metalink-over-http and --trust-server-names, a
           Content-Type: application/metalink4+xml file is named using the
           "Content-Disposition" filename field, if available.

       --content-on-error
           If this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when the
           server responds with a http status code that indicates error.

       --trust-server-names
           If this is set, on a redirect, the local file name will be based on
           the redirection URL.  By default the local file name is based on
           the original URL.  When doing recursive retrieving this can be
           helpful because in many web sites redirected URLs correspond to an
           underlying file structure, while link URLs do not.

       --auth-no-challenge
           If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP authentication
           information (plaintext username and password) for all requests,
           just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.

           Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to
           support some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP
           authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say,
           in addition to form-based authentication.

       --retry-on-host-error
           Consider host errors, such as "Temporary failure in name
           resolution", as non-fatal, transient errors.

       --retry-on-http-error=code[,code,...]
           Consider given HTTP response codes as non-fatal, transient errors.
           Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit HTTP response codes as
           argument. Useful to work around special circumstances where retries
           are required, but the server responds with an error code normally
           not retried by Wget. Such errors might be 503 (Service Unavailable)
           and 429 (Too Many Requests). Retries enabled by this option are
           performed subject to the normal retry timing and retry count
           limitations of Wget.

           Using this option is intended to support special use cases only and
           is generally not recommended, as it can force retries even in cases
           where the server is actually trying to decrease its load. Please
           use wisely and only if you know what you are doing.

   HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options
       To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled with
       an external SSL library. The current default is GnuTLS.  In addition,
       Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).  If Wget is
       compiled without SSL support, none of these options are available.

       --secure-protocol=protocol
           Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are auto,
           SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, TLSv1_3 and PFS.  If auto is
           used, the SSL library is given the liberty of choosing the
           appropriate protocol automatically, which is achieved by sending a
           TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.

           Specifying SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2 or TLSv1_3 forces
           the use of the corresponding protocol.  This is useful when talking
           to old and buggy SSL server implementations that make it hard for
           the underlying SSL library to choose the correct protocol version.
           Fortunately, such servers are quite rare.

           Specifying PFS enforces the use of the so-called Perfect Forward
           Security cipher suites. In short, PFS adds security by creating a
           one-time key for each SSL connection. It has a bit more CPU impact
           on client and server.  We use known to be secure ciphers (e.g. no
           MD4) and the TLS protocol. This mode also explicitly excludes non-
           PFS key exchange methods, such as RSA.

       --https-only
           When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.

       --ciphers
           Set the cipher list string. Typically this string sets the cipher
           suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish should be used,
           in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it 'priority string').
           This string will be fed verbatim to the SSL/TLS engine (OpenSSL or
           GnuTLS) and hence its format and syntax is dependent on that. Wget
           will not process or manipulate it in any way. Refer to the OpenSSL
           or GnuTLS documentation for more information.

       --no-check-certificate
           Don't check the server certificate against the available
           certificate authorities.  Also don't require the URL host name to
           match the common name presented by the certificate.

           As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's certificate
           against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL
           handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails.
           Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
           interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
           versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or
           otherwise invalid certificates.  This option forces an "insecure"
           mode of operation that turns the certificate verification errors
           into warnings and allows you to proceed.

           If you encounter "certificate verification" errors or ones saying
           that "common name doesn't match requested host name", you can use
           this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the
           download.  Only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of
           the site's authenticity, or if you really don't care about the
           validity of its certificate.  It is almost always a bad idea not to
           check the certificates when transmitting confidential or important
           data.  For self-signed/internal certificates, you should download
           the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing this
           insecure mode.  If you are really sure of not desiring any
           certificate verification, you can specify --check-certificate=quiet
           to tell wget to not print any warning about invalid certificates,
           albeit in most cases this is the wrong thing to do.

       --certificate=file
           Use the client certificate stored in file.  This is needed for
           servers that are configured to require certificates from the
           clients that connect to them.  Normally a certificate is not
           required and this switch is optional.

       --certificate-type=type
           Specify the type of the client certificate.  Legal values are PEM
           (assumed by default) and DER, also known as ASN1.

       --private-key=file
           Read the private key from file.  This allows you to provide the
           private key in a file separate from the certificate.

       --private-key-type=type
           Specify the type of the private key.  Accepted values are PEM (the
           default) and DER.

       --ca-certificate=file
           Use file as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities
           ("CA") to verify the peers.  The certificates must be in PEM
           format.

           Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the system-
           specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

       --ca-directory=directory
           Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.  Each
           file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is based on a
           hash value derived from the certificate.  This is achieved by
           processing a certificate directory with the "c_rehash" utility
           supplied with OpenSSL.  Using --ca-directory is more efficient than
           --ca-certificate when many certificates are installed because it
           allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.

           Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the system-
           specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

       --crl-file=file
           Specifies a CRL file in file.  This is needed for certificates that
           have been revocated by the CAs.

       --pinnedpubkey=file/hashes
           Tells wget to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to
           verify the peer.  This can be a path to a file which contains a
           single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64
           encoded sha256 hashes preceded by "sha256//" and separated by ";"

           When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a
           certificate indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from
           this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key(s)
           provided to this option, wget will abort the connection before
           sending or receiving any data.

       --random-file=file
           [OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use file as the source of random data
           for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on systems without
           /dev/urandom.

           On such systems the SSL library needs an external source of
           randomness to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by EGD (see
           --egd-file below) or read from an external source specified by the
           user.  If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random data
           in $RANDFILE or, if that is unset, in $HOME/.rnd.

           If you're getting the "Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling SSL."
           error, you should provide random data using some of the methods
           described above.

       --egd-file=file
           [OpenSSL only] Use file as the EGD socket.  EGD stands for Entropy
           Gathering Daemon, a user-space program that collects data from
           various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to
           other programs that might need it.  Encryption software, such as
           the SSL library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed
           the random number generator used to produce cryptographically
           strong keys.

           OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using
           the "RAND_FILE" environment variable.  If this variable is unset,
           or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness,
           OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket specified using this
           option.

           If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command
           is not used), EGD is never contacted.  EGD is not needed on modern
           Unix systems that support /dev/urandom.

       --no-hsts
           Wget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security, RFC 6797) by
           default.  Use --no-hsts to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-compliant
           UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all the
           "Strict-Transport-Security" headers, and would not enforce any
           existing HSTS policy.

       --hsts-file=file
           By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in ~/.wget-hsts.  You can
           use --hsts-file to override this. Wget will use the supplied file
           as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to the correct HSTS
           database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot parse the provided
           file, the behaviour is unspecified.

           The Wget's HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line contains
           an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a
           "Strict-Transport-Security" header and that therefore has specified
           a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines starting with a dash
           ("#") are ignored by Wget. Please note that in spite of this
           convenient human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS database is
           generally not a good idea.

           An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one or
           more whitespace:

           "<hostname> SP [<port>] SP <include subdomains> SP <created> SP
           <max-age>"

           The hostname and port fields indicate the hostname and port to
           which the given HSTS policy applies. The port field may be zero,
           and it will, in most of the cases. That means that the port number
           will not be taken into account when deciding whether such HSTS
           policy should be applied on a given request (only the hostname will
           be evaluated). When port is different to zero, both the target
           hostname and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy will
           only be applied if both of them match. This feature has been
           included for testing/development purposes only.  The Wget testsuite
           (in testenv/) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the
           purpose of ensuring Wget's correct behaviour. Applying HSTS
           policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC
           6797 (see Appendix B "Differences between HSTS Policy and Same-
           Origin Policy"). Thus, this functionality should not be used in
           production environments and port will typically be zero. The last
           three fields do what they are expected to. The field
           include_subdomains can either be 1 or 0 and it signals whether the
           subdomains of the target domain should be part of the given HSTS
           policy as well. The created and max-age fields hold the timestamp
           values of when such entry was created (first seen by Wget) and the
           HSTS-defined value 'max-age', which states how long should that
           HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds elapsed since the
           timestamp stored in created. Once that time has passed, that HSTS
           policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be removed from
           the database.

           If you supply your own HSTS database via --hsts-file, be aware that
           Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs between the
           HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and those in the
           file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates the HSTS database by
           rewriting the database file with the new entries.

           If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one. This
           file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS entries were
           generated (no "Strict-Transport-Security" headers were sent by any
           of the servers) then no file will be created, not even an empty
           one. This behaviour applies to the default database file
           (~/.wget-hsts) as well: it will not be created until some server
           enforces an HSTS policy.

           Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other Wget
           processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before dumping
           the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and
           merge the changes.

           Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one is
           discouraged.  For more information about the potential security
           threats arose from such practice, see section 14 "Security
           Considerations" of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9 "Creative
           Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store".

       --warc-file=file
           Use file as the destination WARC file.

       --warc-header=string
           Use string into as the warcinfo record.

       --warc-max-size=size
           Set the maximum size of the WARC files to size.

       --warc-cdx
           Write CDX index files.

       --warc-dedup=file
           Do not store records listed in this CDX file.

       --no-warc-compression
           Do not compress WARC files with GZIP.

       --no-warc-digests
           Do not calculate SHA1 digests.

       --no-warc-keep-log
           Do not store the log file in a WARC record.

       --warc-tempdir=dir
           Specify the location for temporary files created by the WARC
           writer.

   FTP Options
       --ftp-user=user
       --ftp-password=password
           Specify the username user and password password on an FTP server.
           Without this, or the corresponding startup option, the password
           defaults to -wget@, normally used for anonymous FTP.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself.
           Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run
           "ps".  To prevent the passwords from being seen, store them in
           .wgetrc or .netrc, and make sure to protect those files from other
           users with "chmod".  If the passwords are really important, do not
           leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and delete
           them after Wget has started the download.

       --no-remove-listing
           Don't remove the temporary .listing files generated by FTP
           retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
           listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
           useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to
           easily check on the contents of remote server directories (e.g. to
           verify that a mirror you're running is complete).

           Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this
           file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
           .listing a symbolic link to /etc/passwd or something and asking
           "root" to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on the
           options used, either Wget will refuse to write to .listing, making
           the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
           symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual .listing
           file, or the listing will be written to a .listing.number file.

           Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, "root" should
           never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
           something as simple as linking index.html to /etc/passwd and asking
           "root" to run Wget with -N or -r so the file will be overwritten.

       --no-glob
           Turn off FTP globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
           special characters (wildcards), like *, ?, [ and ] to retrieve more
           than one file from the same directory at once, like:

                   wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg

           By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
           globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or
           off permanently.

           You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
           your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
           which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with
           Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix "ls" output).

       --no-passive-ftp
           Disable the use of the passive FTP transfer mode.  Passive FTP
           mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the
           data connection rather than the other way around.

           If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive
           and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and
           NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.
           However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually
           works when passive FTP doesn't.  If you suspect this to be the
           case, use this option, or set "passive_ftp=off" in your init file.

       --preserve-permissions
           Preserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set by
           umask.

       --retr-symlinks
           By default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a
           symbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed and
           the pointed-to files are retrieved.  Currently, Wget does not
           traverse symbolic links to directories to download them
           recursively, though this feature may be added in the future.

           When --retr-symlinks=no is specified, the linked-to file is not
           downloaded.  Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the
           local filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless
           this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
           downloaded it anyway.  This option poses a security risk where a
           malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of
           the intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.

           Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
           specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed
           to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed
           in this case.

   FTPS Options
       --ftps-implicit
           This option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly. Implicit FTPS
           consists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of the
           control connection. This option does not send an "AUTH TLS"
           command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly starts an
           SSL/TLS connection. If the attempt is successful, the session
           continues just like regular FTPS ("PBSZ" and "PROT" are sent,
           etc.).  Implicit FTPS is no longer a requirement for FTPS
           implementations, and thus many servers may not support it. If
           --ftps-implicit is passed and no explicit port number specified,
           the default port for implicit FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of
           the default port for the "normal" (explicit) FTPS which is the same
           as that of FTP, 21.

       --no-ftps-resume-ssl
           Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel. When
           starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS
           session previously started in the control connection.  SSL/TLS
           session resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by
           reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous session. Typically,
           the FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget does this by default.
           Under rare circumstances however, one might want to start an
           entirely new SSL/TLS session in every data connection.  This is
           what --no-ftps-resume-ssl is for.

       --ftps-clear-data-connection
           All the data connections will be in plain text. Only the control
           connection will be under SSL/TLS. Wget will send a "PROT C" command
           to achieve this, which must be approved by the server.

       --ftps-fallback-to-ftp
           Fall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by the target server. For
           security reasons, this option is not asserted by default. The
           default behaviour is to exit with an error.  If a server does not
           successfully reply to the initial "AUTH TLS" command, or in the
           case of implicit FTPS, if the initial SSL/TLS connection attempt is
           rejected, it is considered that such server does not support FTPS.

   Recursive Retrieval Options
       -r
       --recursive
           Turn on recursive retrieving.    The default maximum depth is 5.

       -l depth
       --level=depth
           Set the maximum number of subdirectories that Wget will recurse
           into to depth.  In order to prevent one from accidentally
           downloading very large websites when using recursion this is
           limited to a depth of 5 by default, i.e., it will traverse at most
           5 directories deep starting from the provided URL.  Set -l 0 or -l
           inf for infinite recursion depth.

                   wget -r -l 0 http://<site>/1.html

           Ideally, one would expect this to download just 1.html.  but
           unfortunately this is not the case, because -l 0 is equivalent to
           -l inf---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML
           page (or a handful of them), specify them all on the command line
           and leave away -r and -l. To download the essential items to view a
           single HTML page, see page requisites.

       --delete-after
           This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
           after having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular pages
           through a proxy, e.g.:

                   wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/

           The -r option is to retrieve recursively, and -nd to not create
           directories.

           Note that --delete-after deletes files on the local machine.  It
           does not issue the DELE command to remote FTP sites, for instance.
           Also note that when --delete-after is specified, --convert-links is
           ignored, so .orig files are simply not created in the first place.

       -k
       --convert-links
           After the download is complete, convert the links in the document
           to make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the
           visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to
           external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,
           hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.

           Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

           o   The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be
               changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to
               /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then the link in doc.html will
               be modified to point to ../bar/img.gif.  This kind of
               transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
               directories.

           o   The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will
               be changed to include host name and absolute path of the
               location they point to.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to
               /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif), then the link in doc.html
               will be modified to point to http://hostname/bar/img.gif.

           Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file
           was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was
           not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address
           rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former
           links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the
           downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

           Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links
           have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by -k will be
           performed at the end of all the downloads.

       --convert-file-only
           This option converts only the filename part of the URLs, leaving
           the rest of the URLs untouched. This filename part is sometimes
           referred to as the "basename", although we avoid that term here in
           order not to cause confusion.

           It works particularly well in conjunction with --adjust-extension,
           although this coupling is not enforced. It proves useful to
           populate Internet caches with files downloaded from different
           hosts.

           Example: if some link points to //foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz with
           --adjust-extension asserted and its local destination is intended
           to be ./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css, then the link would be converted
           to //foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css. Note that only the filename part has
           been modified. The rest of the URL has been left untouched,
           including the net path ("//") which would otherwise be processed by
           Wget and converted to the effective scheme (ie. "http://").

       -K
       --backup-converted
           When converting a file, back up the original version with a .orig
           suffix.  Affects the behavior of -N.

       -m
       --mirror
           Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
           recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
           keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to -r -N
           -l inf --no-remove-listing.

       -p
       --page-requisites
           This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
           necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes
           such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.

           Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
           documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
           downloaded.  Using -r together with -l can help, but since Wget
           does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
           documents, one is generally left with "leaf documents" that are
           missing their requisites.

           For instance, say document 1.html contains an "<IMG>" tag
           referencing 1.gif and an "<A>" tag pointing to external document
           2.html.  Say that 2.html is similar but that its image is 2.gif and
           it links to 3.html.  Say this continues up to some arbitrarily high
           number.

           If one executes the command:

                   wget -r -l 2 http://<site>/1.html

           then 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, 2.gif, and 3.html will be downloaded.
           As you can see, 3.html is without its requisite 3.gif because Wget
           is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from 1.html in
           order to determine where to stop the recursion.  However, with this
           command:

                   wget -r -l 2 -p http://<site>/1.html

           all the above files and 3.html's requisite 3.gif will be
           downloaded.  Similarly,

                   wget -r -l 1 -p http://<site>/1.html

           will cause 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, and 2.gif to be downloaded.  One
           might think that:

                   wget -r -l 0 -p http://<site>/1.html

           would download just 1.html and 1.gif, but unfortunately this is not
           the case, because -l 0 is equivalent to -l inf---that is, infinite
           recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a handful of them,
           all specified on the command-line or in a -i URL input file) and
           its (or their) requisites, simply leave off -r and -l:

                   wget -p http://<site>/1.html

           Note that Wget will behave as if -r had been specified, but only
           that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from
           that page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to
           download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist
           on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly
           locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to -p:

                   wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<site>/<document>

           To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
           external document link is any URL specified in an "<A>" tag, an
           "<AREA>" tag, or a "<LINK>" tag other than "<LINK
           REL="stylesheet">".

       --strict-comments
           Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments.  The default is to
           terminate comments at the first occurrence of -->.

           According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as SGML
           declarations.  Declaration is special markup that begins with <!
           and ends with >, such as <!DOCTYPE ...>, that may contain comments
           between a pair of -- delimiters.  HTML comments are "empty
           declarations", SGML declarations without any non-comment text.
           Therefore, <!--foo--> is a valid comment, and so is <!--one--
           --two-->, but <!--1--2--> is not.

           On the other hand, most HTML writers don't perceive comments as
           anything other than text delimited with <!-- and -->, which is not
           quite the same.  For example, something like <!------------> works
           as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple of
           four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next --,
           which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of this,
           many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
           implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
           <!-- and -->.

           Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which
           resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in
           browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant
           comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of
           clients that implements "naive" comments, terminating each comment
           at the first occurrence of -->.

           If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
           option to turn it on.

   Recursive Accept/Reject Options
       -A acclist --accept acclist
       -R rejlist --reject rejlist
           Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
           accept or reject. Note that if any of the wildcard characters, *,
           ?, [ or ], appear in an element of acclist or rejlist, it will be
           treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.  In this case, you have
           to enclose the pattern into quotes to prevent your shell from
           expanding it, like in -A "*.mp3" or -A '*.mp3'.

       --accept-regex urlregex
       --reject-regex urlregex
           Specify a regular expression to accept or reject the complete URL.

       --regex-type regextype
           Specify the regular expression type.  Possible types are posix or
           pcre.  Note that to be able to use pcre type, wget has to be
           compiled with libpcre support.

       -D domain-list
       --domains=domain-list
           Set domains to be followed.  domain-list is a comma-separated list
           of domains.  Note that it does not turn on -H.

       --exclude-domains domain-list
           Specify the domains that are not to be followed.

       --follow-ftp
           Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option, Wget
           will ignore all the FTP links.

       --follow-tags=list
           Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it
           considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
           retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
           considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
           comma-separated list with this option.

       --ignore-tags=list
           This is the opposite of the --follow-tags option.  To skip certain
           HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to download,
           specify them in a comma-separated list.

           In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a single
           page and its requisites, using a command-line like:

                   wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r http://<site>/<document>

           However, the author of this option came across a page with tags
           like "<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">" and came to the realization that
           specifying tags to ignore was not enough.  One can't just tell Wget
           to ignore "<LINK>", because then stylesheets will not be
           downloaded.  Now the best bet for downloading a single page and its
           requisites is the dedicated --page-requisites option.

       --ignore-case
           Ignore case when matching files and directories.  This influences
           the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well as globbing
           implemented when downloading from FTP sites.  For example, with
           this option, -A "*.txt" will match file1.txt, but also file2.TXT,
           file3.TxT, and so on.  The quotes in the example are to prevent the
           shell from expanding the pattern.

       -H
       --span-hosts
           Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.

       -L
       --relative
           Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home
           page without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts.

       -I list
       --include-directories=list
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow
           when downloading.  Elements of list may contain wildcards.

       -X list
       --exclude-directories=list
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude
           from download.  Elements of list may contain wildcards.

       -np
       --no-parent
           Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
           recursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees that
           only the files below a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels

              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The

              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate suc-
                     ceeded or failed.

              search Navigate the directory tree verbosely.

              stat   Print  messages  as  files are examined with the stat and
                     lstat system calls.  The find program tries  to  minimise
                     such calls.

              tree   Show  the  expression  tree in its original and optimised
                     form.

              all    Enable all of the other debug options (but help).

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

COMMAND: mount

DESCRIPTION: mount - mount a filesystem

USAGE: mount [-h|-V]

       mount [-l] [-t fstype]

       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-O optlist]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options] device|mountpoint

       mount
       --make-[shared|slave|private|unbindable|rshared|rslave|rprivate|runbindable]
       mountpoint

OPTIONS:
The full set of mount options used by an invocation of mount is
       determined by first extracting the mount options for the filesystem
       from the fstab table, then applying any options specified by the -o
       argument, and finally applying a -r or -w option, when present.

       The mount command does not pass all command-line options to the
       /sbin/mount.suffix mount helpers. The interface between mount and the
       mount helpers is described below in the EXTERNAL HELPERS section.

       Command-line options available for the mount command are:

       -a, --all
           Mount all filesystems (of the given types) mentioned in fstab
           (except for those whose line contains the noauto keyword). The
           filesystems are mounted following their order in fstab. The mount
           command compares filesystem source, target (and fs root for bind
           mount or btrfs) to detect already mounted filesystems. The kernel
           table with already mounted filesystems is cached during mount
           --all. This means that all duplicated fstab entries will be
           mounted.

           The correct functionality depends on /proc (to detect already
           mounted filesystems) and on /sys (to evaluate filesystem tags like
           UUID= or LABEL=). It's strongly recommended to mount /proc and /sys
           filesystems before mount -a is executed, or keep /proc and /sys at
           the beginning of fstab.

           The option --all is possible to use for remount operation too. In
           this case all filters (-t and -O) are applied to the table of
           already mounted filesystems.

           Since version 2.35 it is possible to use the command line option -o
           to alter mount options from fstab (see also --options-mode).

           Note that it is a bad practice to use mount -a for fstab checking.
           The recommended solution is findmnt --verify.

       -B, --bind
           Remount a subtree somewhere else (so that its contents are
           available in both places). See above, under Bind mounts.

       -c, --no-canonicalize
           Don't canonicalize paths. The mount command canonicalizes all paths
           (from the command line or fstab) by default. This option can be
           used together with the -f flag for already canonicalized absolute
           paths. The option is designed for mount helpers which call mount
           -i. It is strongly recommended to not use this command-line option
           for normal mount operations.

           Note that mount does not pass this option to the /sbin/mount.type
           helpers.

       -F, --fork
           (Used in conjunction with -a.) Fork off a new incarnation of mount
           for each device. This will do the mounts on different devices or
           different NFS servers in parallel. This has the advantage that it
           is faster; also NFS timeouts proceed in parallel. A disadvantage is
           that the order of the mount operations is undefined. Thus, you
           cannot use this option if you want to mount both /usr and
           /usr/spool.

       -f, --fake
           Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call; if
           it's not obvious, this "fakes" mounting the filesystem. This option
           is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to determine what the
           mount command is trying to do. It can also be used to add entries
           for devices that were mounted earlier with the -n option. The -f
           option checks for an existing record in /etc/mtab and fails when
           the record already exists (with a regular non-fake mount, this
           check is done by the kernel).

       -i, --internal-only
           Don't call the /sbin/mount.filesystem helper even if it exists.

       -L, --label label
           Mount the partition that has the specified label.

       -l, --show-labels
           Add the labels in the mount output. mount must have permission to
           read the disk device (e.g. be set-user-ID root) for this to work.
           One can set such a label for ext2, ext3 or ext4 using the
           e2label(8) utility, or for XFS using xfs_admin(8), or for reiserfs
           using reiserfstune(8).

       -M, --move
           Move a subtree to some other place. See above, the subsection The
           move operation.

       -m, --mkdir[=mode]
           Allow to make a target directory (mountpoint) if it does not exist
           yet. Alias to "-o X-mount.mkdir[=mode]", the default mode is 0755.
           For more details see X-mount.mkdir below.

       -n, --no-mtab
           Mount without writing in /etc/mtab. This is necessary for example
           when /etc is on a read-only filesystem.

       -N, --namespace ns
           Perform the mount operation in the mount namespace specified by ns.
           ns is either PID of process running in that namespace or special
           file representing that namespace.

           mount switches to the mount namespace when it reads /etc/fstab,
           writes /etc/mtab: (or writes to _/run/mount) and calls mount(2),
           otherwise it runs in the original mount namespace. This means that
           the target namespace does not have to contain any libraries or
           other requirements necessary to execute the mount(2) call.

           See mount_namespaces(7) for more information.

       -O, --test-opts opts
           Limit the set of filesystems to which the -a option applies. In
           this regard it is like the -t option except that -O is useless
           without -a. For example, the command

           mount -a -O no_netdev

           mounts all filesystems except those which have the option netdev
           specified in the options field in the /etc/fstab file.

           It is different from -t in that each option is matched exactly; a
           leading no at the beginning of one option does not negate the rest.

           The -t and -O options are cumulative in effect; that is, the
           command

           mount -a -t ext2 -O  _netdev

           mounts all ext2 filesystems with the _netdev option, not all
           filesystems that are either ext2 or have the _netdev option
           specified.

       -o, --options opts
           Use the specified mount options. The opts argument is a
           comma-separated list. For example:

           mount LABEL=mydisk -o noatime,nodev,nosuid

           For more details, see the FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS and
           FILESYSTEM-SPECIFIC MOUNT OPTIONS sections.

       --options-mode mode
           Controls how to combine options from fstab/mtab with options from
           the command line. mode can be one of ignore, append, prepend or
           replace. For example, append means that options from fstab are
           appended to options from the command line. The default value is
           prepend -- it means command line options are evaluated after fstab
           options. Note that the last option wins if there are conflicting
           ones.

       --options-source source
           Source of default options. source is a comma-separated list of
           fstab, mtab and disable. disable disables fstab and mtab and
           enables --options-source-force. The default value is fstab,mtab.

       --options-source-force
           Use options from fstab/mtab even if both device and dir are
           specified.

       -R, --rbind
           Remount a subtree and all possible submounts somewhere else (so
           that its contents are available in both places). See above, the
           subsection Bind mounts.

       -r, --read-only
           Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is -o ro.

           Note that, depending on the filesystem type, state and kernel
           behavior, the system may still write to the device. For example,
           ext3 and ext4 will replay the journal if the filesystem is dirty.
           To prevent this kind of write access, you may want to mount an ext3
           or ext4 filesystem with the ro,noload mount options or set the
           block device itself to read-only mode, see the blockdev(8) command.

       -s
           Tolerate sloppy mount options rather than failing. This will ignore
           mount options not supported by a filesystem type. Not all
           filesystems support this option. Currently it's supported by the
           mount.nfs mount helper only.

       --source device
           If only one argument for the mount command is given, then the
           argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or source
           (device). This option allows you to explicitly define that the
           argument is the mount source.

       --target directory
           If only one argument for the mount command is given, then the
           argument might be interpreted as the target (mountpoint) or source
           (device). This option allows you to explicitly define that the
           argument is the mount target.

       --target-prefix directory
           Prepend the specified directory to all mount targets. This option
           can be used to follow fstab, but mount operations are done in
           another place, for example:

           mount --all --target-prefix /chroot -o X-mount.mkdir

           mounts all from system fstab to /chroot, all missing mountpoint are
           created (due to X-mount.mkdir). See also --fstab to use an
           alternative fstab.

       -T, --fstab path
           Specifies an alternative fstab file. If path is a directory, then
           the files in the directory are sorted by strverscmp(3); files that
           start with "." or without an .fstab extension are ignored. The
           option can be specified more than once. This option is mostly
           designed for initramfs or chroot scripts where additional
           configuration is specified beyond standard system configuration.

           Note that mount does not pass the option --fstab to the
           /sbin/mount.type helpers, meaning that the alternative fstab files
           will be invisible for the helpers. This is no problem for normal
           mounts, but user (non-root) mounts always require fstab to verify
           the user's rights.

       -t, --types fstype
           The argument following the -t is used to indicate the filesystem
           type. The filesystem types which are currently supported depend on
           the running kernel. See /proc/filesystems and /lib/modules/$(uname
           -r)/kernel/fs for a complete list of the filesystems. The most
           common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and
           cifs.

           The programs mount and umount(8) support filesystem subtypes. The
           subtype is defined by a '.subtype' suffix. For example
           'fuse.sshfs'. It's recommended to use subtype notation rather than
           add any prefix to the mount source (for example 'sshfs#example.com'
           is deprecated).

           If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is specified, mount
           will try to guess the desired type. mount uses the libblkid(3)
           library for guessing the filesystem type; if that does not turn up
           anything that looks familiar, mount will try to read the file
           /etc/filesystems, or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
           All of the filesystem types listed there will be tried, except for
           those that are labeled "nodev" (e.g. devpts, proc and nfs). If
           /etc/filesystems ends in a line with a single *, mount will read
           /proc/filesystems afterwards. While trying, all filesystem types
           will be mounted with the mount option silent.

           The auto type may be useful for user-mounted floppies. Creating a
           file /etc/filesystems can be useful to change the probe order
           (e.g., to try vfat before msdos or ext3 before ext2) or if you use
           a kernel module autoloader.

           More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list, for
           the -t option as well as in an /etc/fstab entry. The list of
           filesystem types for the -t option can be prefixed with no to
           specify the filesystem types on which no action should be taken.
           The prefix no has no effect when specified in an /etc/fstab entry.

           The prefix no can be meaningful with the -a option. For example,
           the command

           mount -a -t nomsdos,smbfs

           mounts all filesystems except those of type msdos and smbfs.

           For most types all the mount program has to do is issue a simple
           mount(2) system call, and no detailed knowledge of the filesystem
           type is required. For a few types however (like nfs, nfs4, cifs,
           smbfs, ncpfs) an ad hoc code is necessary. The nfs, nfs4, cifs,
           smbfs, and ncpfs filesystems have a separate mount program. In
           order to make it possible to treat all types in a uniform way,
           mount will execute the program /sbin/mount.type (if that exists)
           when called with type type. Since different versions of the
           smbmount program have different calling conventions,
           /sbin/mount.smbfs may have to be a shell script that sets up the
           desired call.

       -U, --uuid uuid
           Mount the partition that has the specified uuid.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose mode.

       -w, --rw, --read-write
           Mount the filesystem read/write. Read-write is the kernel default
           and the mount default is to try read-only if the previous mount(2)
           syscall with read-write flags on write-protected devices failed.

           A synonym is -o rw.

           Note that specifying -w on the command line forces mount to never
           try read-only mount on write-protected devices or already mounted
           read-only filesystems.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: findmnt

DESCRIPTION: findmnt - find a filesystem

USAGE: findmnt [options]

       findmnt [options] device|mountpoint

       findmnt [options] [--source] device [--target path|--mountpoint
       mountpoint]

OPTIONS:
-A, --all
           Disable all built-in filters and print all filesystems.

       -a, --ascii
           Use ascii characters for tree formatting.

       -b, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit
           prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are
           exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability, by
           exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1
           MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting
           on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.

       -C, --nocanonicalize
           Do not canonicalize paths at all. This option affects the comparing
           of paths and the evaluation of tags (LABEL, UUID, etc.).

       -c, --canonicalize
           Canonicalize all printed paths.

       --deleted
           Print filesystems where target (mountpoint) is marked as deleted by
           kernel.

       -D, --df
           Imitate the output of df(1). This option is equivalent to -o
           SOURCE,FSTYPE,SIZE,USED,AVAIL,USE%,TARGET but excludes all pseudo
           filesystems. Use --all to print all filesystems.

       -d, --direction word
           The search direction, either forward or backward.

       -e, --evaluate
           Convert all tags (LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID, or PARTLABEL) to the
           corresponding device names for the SOURCE column. It's an unusual
           situation, but the same tag may be duplicated (used for more
           devices). For this purpose, there is SOURCES (pl.) column. This
           column displays by multi-line cell all devices where the tag is
           detected by libblkid. This option makes sense for fstab only.

       -F, --tab-file path
           Search in an alternative file. If used with --fstab, --mtab or
           --kernel, then it overrides the default paths. If specified more
           than once, then tree-like output is disabled (see the --list
           option).

       -f, --first-only
           Print the first matching filesystem only.

       -i, --invert
           Invert the sense of matching.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format.

       -k, --kernel
           Search in /proc/self/mountinfo. The output is in the tree-like
           format. This is the default. The output contains only mount options
           maintained by kernel (see also --mtab).

       -l, --list
           Use the list output format. This output format is automatically
           enabled if the output is restricted by the -t, -O, -S or -T option
           and the option --submounts is not used or if more that one source
           file (the option -F) is specified.

       -M, --mountpoint path
           Explicitly define the mountpoint file or directory. See also
           --target.

       -m, --mtab
           Search in /etc/mtab. The output is in the list format by default
           (see --tree). The output may include user space mount options.

       -N, --task tid
           Use alternative namespace /proc/<tid>/mountinfo rather than the
           default /proc/self/mountinfo. If the option is specified more than
           once, then tree-like output is disabled (see the --list option).
           See also the unshare(1) command.

       -n, --noheadings
           Do not print a header line.

       -O, --options list
           Limit the set of printed filesystems. More than one option may be
           specified in a comma-separated list. The -t and -O options are
           cumulative in effect. It is different from -t in that each option
           is matched exactly; a leading no at the beginning does not have
           global meaning. The "no" can used for individual items in the list.
           The "no" prefix interpretation can be disabled by "+" prefix.

       -o, --output list
           Define output columns. See the --help output to get a list of the
           currently supported columns. The TARGET column contains tree
           formatting if the --list or --raw options are not specified.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., findmnt -o +PROPAGATION).

       --output-all
           Output almost all available columns. The columns that require
           --poll are not included.

       -P, --pairs
           Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. All potentially
           unsafe value characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>). See also option
           --shell.

       -p, --poll[=list]
           Monitor changes in the /proc/self/mountinfo file. Supported actions
           are: mount, umount, remount and move. More than one action may be
           specified in a comma-separated list. All actions are monitored by
           default.

           The time for which --poll will block can be restricted with the
           --timeout or --first-only options.

           The standard columns always use the new version of the information
           from the mountinfo file, except the umount action which is based on
           the original information cached by findmnt. The poll mode allows
           using extra columns:

           ACTION
               mount, umount, move or remount action name; this column is
               enabled by default

           OLD-TARGET
               available for umount and move actions

           OLD-OPTIONS
               available for umount and remount actions

       --pseudo
           Print only pseudo filesystems.

       --shadow
           Print only filesystems over-mounted by another filesystem.

       -R, --submounts
           Print recursively all submounts for the selected filesystems. The
           restrictions defined by options -t, -O, -S, -T and --direction are
           not applied to submounts. All submounts are always printed in
           tree-like order. The option enables the tree-like output format by
           default. This option has no effect for --mtab or --fstab.

       -r, --raw
           Use raw output format. All potentially unsafe characters are
           hex-escaped (\x<code>).

       --real
           Print only real filesystems.

       -S, --source spec
           Explicitly define the mount source. Supported specifications are
           device, maj:min, LABEL=label, UUID=uuid, PARTLABEL=label and
           PARTUUID=uuid.

       -s, --fstab
           Search in /etc/fstab. The output is in the list format (see
           --list).

       -T, --target path
           Define the mount target. If path is not a mountpoint file or
           directory, then findmnt checks the path elements in reverse order
           to get the mountpoint (this feature is supported only when
           searching in kernel files and unsupported for --fstab). It's
           recommended to use the option --mountpoint when checks of path
           elements are unwanted and path is a strictly specified mountpoint.

       -t, --types list
           Limit the set of printed filesystems. More than one type may be
           specified in a comma-separated list. The list of filesystem types
           can be prefixed with no to specify the filesystem types on which no
           action should be taken. For more details see mount(8).

       --tree
           Enable tree-like output if possible. The options is silently
           ignored for tables where is missing child-parent relation (e.g.,
           fstab).

       --shadowed
           Print only filesystems over-mounted by another filesystem.

       -U, --uniq
           Ignore filesystems with duplicate mount targets, thus effectively
           skipping over-mounted mount points.

       -u, --notruncate
           Do not truncate text in columns. The default is to not truncate the
           TARGET, SOURCE, UUID, LABEL, PARTUUID, PARTLABEL columns. This
           option disables text truncation also in all other columns.

       -v, --nofsroot
           Do not print a [/dir] in the SOURCE column for bind mounts or btrfs
           subvolumes.

       -w, --timeout milliseconds
           Specify an upper limit on the time for which --poll will block, in
           milliseconds.

       -x, --verify
           Check mount table content. The default is to verify /etc/fstab
           parsability and usability. It's possible to use this option also
           with --tab-file. It's possible to specify source (device) or target
           (mountpoint) to filter mount table. The option --verbose forces
           findmnt to print more details.

       --verbose
           Force findmnt to print more information (--verify only for now).

       --vfs-all
           When used with VFS-OPTIONS column, print all VFS (fs-independent)
           flags. This option is designed for auditing purposes to list also
           default VFS kernel mount options which are normally not listed.

       -y, --shell
           The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed
           for shell variable identifiers. This is usable, for example, with
           --pairs. Note that this feature has been automatically enabled for
           --pairs in version 2.37, but due to compatibility issues, now it's
           necessary to request this behavior by --shell.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

COMMAND: lsblk

DESCRIPTION: lsblk - list block devices

USAGE: lsblk [options] [device...]

OPTIONS:
-A, --noempty
           Don't print empty devices.

       -a, --all
           Disable all built-in filters and list all empty devices and RAM
           disk devices too.

       -b, --bytes
           Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

           By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and unit
           prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are
           exhibited truncated in order to reach a better readability, by
           exhibiting alone the first letter of them; examples: "1 KiB" and "1
           MiB" are respectively exhibited as "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting
           on purpose the mention "iB", which is part of these abbreviations.

       -D, --discard
           Print information about the discarding capabilities (TRIM, UNMAP)
           for each device.

       -d, --nodeps
           Do not print holder devices or slaves. For example, lsblk --nodeps
           /dev/sda prints information about the sda device only.

       -E, --dedup column
           Use column as a de-duplication key to de-duplicate output tree. If
           the key is not available for the device, or the device is a
           partition and parental whole-disk device provides the same key than
           the device is always printed.

           The usual use case is to de-duplicate output on system multi-path
           devices, for example by -E WWN.

       -e, --exclude list
           Exclude the devices specified by the comma-separated list of major
           device numbers. Note that RAM disks (major=1) are excluded by
           default if --all is not specified. The filter is applied to the
           top-level devices only. This may be confusing for --list output
           format where hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.

       -f, --fs
           Output info about filesystems. This option is equivalent to -o
           NAME,FSTYPE,FSVER,LABEL,UUID,FSAVAIL,FSUSE%,MOUNTPOINTS. The
           authoritative information about filesystems and raids is provided
           by the blkid(8) command.

       -I, --include list
           Include devices specified by the comma-separated list of major
           device numbers. The filter is applied to the top-level devices
           only. This may be confusing for --list output format where
           hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.

       -i, --ascii
           Use ASCII characters for tree formatting.

       -J, --json
           Use JSON output format. It's strongly recommended to use --output
           and also --tree if necessary.

       -l, --list
           Produce output in the form of a list. The output does not provide
           information about relationships between devices and since version
           2.34 every device is printed only once if --pairs or --raw not
           specified (the parsable outputs are maintained in backwardly
           compatible way).

       -M, --merge
           Group parents of sub-trees to provide more readable output for
           RAIDs and Multi-path devices. The tree-like output is required.

       -m, --perms
           Output info about device owner, group and mode. This option is
           equivalent to -o NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE.

       -n, --noheadings
           Do not print a header line.

       -o, --output list
           Specify which output columns to print. Use --help to get a list of
           all supported columns. The columns may affect tree-like output. The
           default is to use tree for the column 'NAME' (see also --tree).

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., lsblk -o +UUID).

       -O, --output-all
           Output all available columns.

       -P, --pairs
           Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. The output lines
           are still ordered by dependencies. All potentially unsafe value
           characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>). See also option --shell.

       -p, --paths
           Print full device paths.

       -r, --raw
           Produce output in raw format. The output lines are still ordered by
           dependencies. All potentially unsafe characters are hex-escaped
           (\x<code>) in the NAME, KNAME, LABEL, PARTLABEL and MOUNTPOINT
           columns.

       -S, --scsi
           Output info about SCSI devices only. All partitions, slaves and
           holder devices are ignored.

       -s, --inverse
           Print dependencies in inverse order. If the --list output is
           requested then the lines are still ordered by dependencies.

       -T, --tree[=column]
           Force tree-like output format. If column is specified, then a tree
           is printed in the column. The default is NAME column.

       -t, --topology
           Output info about block-device topology. This option is equivalent
           to

           -o
           NAME,ALIGNMENT,MIN-IO,OPT-IO,PHY-SEC,LOG-SEC,ROTA,SCHED,RQ-SIZE,RA,WSAME.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

       -w, --width number
           Specifies output width as a number of characters. The default is
           the number of the terminal columns, and if not executed on a
           terminal, then output width is not restricted at all by default.
           This option also forces lsblk to assume that terminal control
           characters and unsafe characters are not allowed. The expected
           use-case is for example when lsblk is used by the watch(1) command.

       -x, --sort column
           Sort output lines by column. This option enables --list output
           format by default. It is possible to use the option --tree to force
           tree-like output and than the tree branches are sorted by the
           column.

       -y, --shell
           The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed
           for shell variable identifiers, for example, MIN_IO and FSUSE_PCT
           instead of MIN-IO and FSUSE%. This is usable, for example, with
           --pairs. Note that this feature has been automatically enabled for
           --pairs in version 2.37, but due to compatibility issues, now it's
           necessary to request this behavior by --shell.

       -z, --zoned
           Print the zone related information for each device.

       --sysroot directory
           Gather data for a Linux instance other than the instance from which
           the lsblk command is issued. The specified directory is the system
           root of the Linux instance to be inspected. The real device nodes
           in the target directory can be replaced by text files with udev
           attributes.

COMMAND: fdisk

DESCRIPTION: fdisk - manipulate disk partition table

USAGE: fdisk [options] device

       fdisk -l [device...]

OPTIONS:
-b, --sector-size sectorsize
           Specify the sector size of the disk. Valid values are 512, 1024,
           2048, and 4096. (Recent kernels know the sector size. Use this
           option only on old kernels or to override the kernel's ideas.)
           Since util-linux-2.17, fdisk differentiates between logical and
           physical sector size. This option changes both sector sizes to
           sectorsize.

       -B, --protect-boot
           Don't erase the beginning of the first disk sector when creating a
           new disk label. This feature is supported for GPT and MBR.

       -c, --compatibility[=mode]
           Specify the compatibility mode, 'dos' or 'nondos'. The default is
           non-DOS mode. For backward compatibility, it is possible to use the
           option without the mode argument -- then the default is used. Note
           that the optional mode argument cannot be separated from the -c
           option by a space, the correct form is for example -c=dos.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

       -L, --color[=when]
           Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto, never
           or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to auto.
           The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see
           the --help output. See also the COLORS section.

       -l, --list
           List the partition tables for the specified devices and then exit.

           If no devices are given, the devices mentioned in /proc/partitions
           (if this file exists) are used. Devices are always listed in the
           order in which they are specified on the command-line, or by the
           kernel listed in /proc/partitions.

       -x, --list-details
           Like --list, but provides more details.

       --lock[=mode]
           Use exclusive BSD lock for device or file it operates. The optional
           argument mode can be yes, no (or 1 and 0) or nonblock. If the mode
           argument is omitted, it defaults to yes. This option overwrites
           environment variable $LOCK_BLOCK_DEVICE. The default is not to use
           any lock at all, but it's recommended to avoid collisions with
           systemd-udevd(8) or other tools.

       -n, --noauto-pt
           Don't automatically create a default partition table on empty
           device. The partition table has to be explicitly created by user
           (by command like 'o', 'g', etc.).

       -o, --output list
           Specify which output columns to print. Use --help to get a list of
           all supported columns.

           The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in
           the format +list (e.g., -o +UUID).

       -s, --getsz
           Print the size in 512-byte sectors of each given block device. This
           option is DEPRECATED in favour of blockdev(8).

       -t, --type type
           Enable support only for disklabels of the specified type, and
           disable support for all other types.

       -u, --units[=unit]
           When listing partition tables, show sizes in 'sectors' or in
           'cylinders'. The default is to show sizes in sectors. For backward
           compatibility, it is possible to use the option without the unit
           argument -- then the default is used. Note that the optional unit
           argument cannot be separated from the -u option by a space, the
           correct form is for example '-u=cylinders'.

       -C, --cylinders number
           Specify the number of cylinders of the disk. I have no idea why
           anybody would want to do so.

       -H, --heads number
           Specify the number of heads of the disk. (Not the physical number,
           of course, but the number used for partition tables.) Reasonable
           values are 255 and 16.

       -S, --sectors number
           Specify the number of sectors per track of the disk. (Not the
           physical number, of course, but the number used for partition
           tables.) A reasonable value is 63.

       -w, --wipe when
           Wipe filesystem, RAID and partition-table signatures from the
           device, in order to avoid possible collisions. The argument when
           can be auto, never or always. When this option is not given, the
           default is auto, in which case signatures are wiped only when in
           interactive mode. In all cases detected signatures are reported by
           warning messages before a new partition table is created. See also
           wipefs(8) command.

       -W, --wipe-partitions when
           Wipe filesystem, RAID and partition-table signatures from a newly
           created partitions, in order to avoid possible collisions. The
           argument when can be auto, never or always. When this option is not
           given, the default is auto, in which case signatures are wiped only
           when in interactive mode and after confirmation by user. In all
           cases detected signatures are reported by warning messages before a
           new partition is created. See also wipefs(8) command.

       -V, --version
           Display version information and exit.

COMMAND: ping

DESCRIPTION: ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

USAGE: ping [-aAbBdCDefhLnOqrRUvV46] [-c count] [-F flowlabel] [-i interval]
            [-I interface] [-l preload] [-m mark] [-M pmtudisc_option]
            [-N nodeinfo_option] [-w deadline] [-W timeout] [-p pattern]
            [-Q tos] [-s packetsize] [-S sndbuf] [-t ttl]
            [-T timestamp option] [hop...] {destination}

OPTIONS:
-4
           Use IPv4 only.

       -6
           Use IPv6 only.

       -a
           Audible ping.

       -A
           Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so
           that effectively not more than one (or more, if preload is set)
           unanswered probe is present in the network. Minimal interval is
           200msec unless super-user. On networks with low RTT this mode is
           essentially equivalent to flood mode.

       -b
           Allow pinging a broadcast address.

       -B
           Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address
           is bound to one selected when ping starts.

       -c count
           Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets. With deadline
           option, ping waits for count ECHO_REPLY packets, until the timeout
           expires.

       -C
           Call connect() syscall on socket creation.

       -d
           Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used. Essentially, this
           socket option is not used by Linux kernel.

       -e
           Set the identification field of ECHO_REQUEST. Value 0 implies using
           raw socket (not supported on ICMP datagram socket). The value of
           the field may be printed with -v option.

       -D
           Print timestamp (unix time + microseconds as in gettimeofday)
           before each line.

       -f
           Flood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period "." is printed,
           while for every ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This
           provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. If
           interval is not given, it sets interval to zero and outputs packets
           as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
           whichever is more. Only the super-user may use this option with
           zero interval.

       -F flow label
           IPv6 only. Allocate and set 20 bit flow label (in hex) on echo
           request packets. If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow
           label.

       -h
           Show help.

       -i interval
           Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. Real number
           allowed with dot as a decimal separator (regardless locale setup).
           The default is to wait for one second between each packet normally,
           or not to wait in flood mode. Only super-user may set interval to
           values less than 2 ms.

       -I interface
           interface is either an address, an interface name or a VRF name. If
           interface is an address, it sets source address to specified
           interface address. If interface is an interface name, it sets
           source interface to specified interface. If interface is a VRF
           name, each packet is routed using the corresponding routing table;
           in this case, the -I option can be repeated to specify a source
           address. NOTE: For IPv6, when doing ping to a link-local scope
           address, link specification (by the '%'-notation in destination, or
           by this option) can be used but it is no longer required.

       -l preload
           If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets not waiting
           for reply. Only the super-user may select preload more than 3.

       -L
           Suppress loopback of multicast packets. This flag only applies if
           the ping destination is a multicast address.

       -m mark
           use mark to tag the packets going out. This is useful for variety
           of reasons within the kernel such as using policy routing to select
           specific outbound processing.

       -M pmtudisc_opt
           Select Path MTU Discovery strategy.  pmtudisc_option may be either
           do (prohibit fragmentation, even local one), want (do PMTU
           discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large), or dont (do
           not set DF flag).

       -N nodeinfo_option
           IPv6 only. Send ICMPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620), instead
           of Echo Request. CAP_NET_RAW capability is required.

           help
               Show help for NI support.

           name
               Queries for Node Names.

           ipv6
               Queries for IPv6 Addresses. There are several IPv6 specific
               flags.

               ipv6-global
                   Request IPv6 global-scope addresses.

               ipv6-sitelocal
                   Request IPv6 site-local addresses.

               ipv6-linklocal
                   Request IPv6 link-local addresses.

               ipv6-all
                   Request IPv6 addresses on other interfaces.

           ipv4
               Queries for IPv4 Addresses. There is one IPv4 specific flag.

               ipv4-all
                   Request IPv4 addresses on other interfaces.

           subject-ipv6=ipv6addr
               IPv6 subject address.

           subject-ipv4=ipv4addr
               IPv4 subject address.

           subject-name=nodename
               Subject name. If it contains more than one dot, fully-qualified
               domain name is assumed.

           subject-fqdn=nodename
               Subject name. Fully-qualified domain name is always assumed.

       -n
           Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
           names for host addresses.

       -O
           Report outstanding ICMP ECHO reply before sending next packet. This
           is useful together with the timestamp -D to log output to a
           diagnostic file and search for missing answers.

       -p pattern
           You may specify up to 16 "pad" bytes to fill out the packet you
           send. This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
           network. For example, -p ff will cause the sent packet to be filled
           with all ones.

       -q
           Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at
           startup time and when finished.

       -Q tos
           Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams.  tos can be
           decimal (ping only) or hex number.

           In RFC2474, these fields are interpreted as 8-bit Differentiated
           Services (DS), consisting of: bits 0-1 (2 lowest bits) of separate
           data, and bits 2-7 (highest 6 bits) of Differentiated Services
           Codepoint (DSCP). In RFC2481 and RFC3168, bits 0-1 are used for
           ECN.

           Historically (RFC1349, obsoleted by RFC2474), these were
           interpreted as: bit 0 (lowest bit) for reserved (currently being
           redefined as congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and bits
           5-7 (highest bits) for Precedence.

       -r
           Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an
           attached interface. If the host is not on a directly-attached
           network, an error is returned. This option can be used to ping a
           local host through an interface that has no route through it
           provided the option -I is also used.

       -R
           ping only. Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the
           ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on returned
           packets. Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such
           routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this option.

       -s packetsize
           Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56,
           which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8
           bytes of ICMP header data.

       -S sndbuf
           Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not
           more than one packet.

       -t ttl
           ping only. Set the IP Time to Live.

       -T timestamp option
           Set special IP timestamp options.  timestamp option may be either
           tsonly (only timestamps), tsandaddr (timestamps and addresses) or
           tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp prespecified
           hops).

       -U
           Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour). Normally ping
           prints network round trip time, which can be different f.e. due to
           DNS failures.

       -v
           Verbose output. Do not suppress DUP replies when pinging multicast
           address.

       -V
           Show version and exit.

       -w deadline
           Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how
           many packets have been sent or received. In this case ping does not
           stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline
           expire or until count probes are answered or for some error
           notification from network.

       -W timeout
           Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only
           timeout in absence of any responses, otherwise ping waits for two
           RTTs. Real number allowed with dot as a decimal separator
           (regardless locale setup). 0 means infinite timeout.

       When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the
       local host, to verify that the local network interface is up and
       running. Then, hosts and gateways further and further away should be
       "pinged". Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed. If
       duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet
       loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used
       in calculating the minimum/average/maximum/mdev round-trip time
       numbers.

       Population standard deviation (mdev), essentially an average of how far
       each ping RTT is from the mean RTT. The higher mdev is, the more
       variable the RTT is (over time). With a high RTT variability, you will
       have speed issues with bulk transfers (they will take longer than is
       strictly speaking necessary, as the variability will eventually cause
       the sender to wait for ACKs) and you will have middling to poor VoIP
       quality.

       When the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or
       if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is
       displayed. Shorter current statistics can be obtained without
       termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.

       If ping does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with
       code 1. If a packet count and deadline are both specified, and fewer
       than count packets are received by the time the deadline has arrived,
       it will also exit with code 1. On other error it exits with code 2.
       Otherwise it exits with code 0. This makes it possible to use the exit
       code to see if a host is alive or not.

       This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
       management. Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is
       unwise to use ping during normal operations or from automated scripts.

COMMAND: ping

DESCRIPTION: ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

USAGE: ping [-aAbBdCDefhLnOqrRUvV46] [-c count] [-F flowlabel] [-i interval]
            [-I interface] [-l preload] [-m mark] [-M pmtudisc_option]
            [-N nodeinfo_option] [-w deadline] [-W timeout] [-p pattern]
            [-Q tos] [-s packetsize] [-S sndbuf] [-t ttl]
            [-T timestamp option] [hop...] {destination}

OPTIONS:
-4
           Use IPv4 only.

       -6
           Use IPv6 only.

       -a
           Audible ping.

       -A
           Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so
           that effectively not more than one (or more, if preload is set)
           unanswered probe is present in the network. Minimal interval is
           200msec unless super-user. On networks with low RTT this mode is
           essentially equivalent to flood mode.

       -b
           Allow pinging a broadcast address.

       -B
           Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address
           is bound to one selected when ping starts.

       -c count
           Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets. With deadline
           option, ping waits for count ECHO_REPLY packets, until the timeout
           expires.

       -C
           Call connect() syscall on socket creation.

       -d
           Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used. Essentially, this
           socket option is not used by Linux kernel.

       -e
           Set the identification field of ECHO_REQUEST. Value 0 implies using
           raw socket (not supported on ICMP datagram socket). The value of
           the field may be printed with -v option.

       -D
           Print timestamp (unix time + microseconds as in gettimeofday)
           before each line.

       -f
           Flood ping. For every ECHO_REQUEST sent a period "." is printed,
           while for every ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This
           provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. If
           interval is not given, it sets interval to zero and outputs packets
           as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
           whichever is more. Only the super-user may use this option with
           zero interval.

       -F flow label
           IPv6 only. Allocate and set 20 bit flow label (in hex) on echo
           request packets. If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow
           label.

       -h
           Show help.

       -i interval
           Wait interval seconds between sending each packet. Real number
           allowed with dot as a decimal separator (regardless locale setup).
           The default is to wait for one second between each packet normally,
           or not to wait in flood mode. Only super-user may set interval to
           values less than 2 ms.

       -I interface
           interface is either an address, an interface name or a VRF name. If
           interface is an address, it sets source address to specified
           interface address. If interface is an interface name, it sets
           source interface to specified interface. If interface is a VRF
           name, each packet is routed using the corresponding routing table;
           in this case, the -I option can be repeated to specify a source
           address. NOTE: For IPv6, when doing ping to a link-local scope
           address, link specification (by the '%'-notation in destination, or
           by this option) can be used but it is no longer required.

       -l preload
           If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets not waiting
           for reply. Only the super-user may select preload more than 3.

       -L
           Suppress loopback of multicast packets. This flag only applies if
           the ping destination is a multicast address.

       -m mark
           use mark to tag the packets going out. This is useful for variety
           of reasons within the kernel such as using policy routing to select
           specific outbound processing.

       -M pmtudisc_opt
           Select Path MTU Discovery strategy.  pmtudisc_option may be either
           do (prohibit fragmentation, even local one), want (do PMTU
           discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large), or dont (do
           not set DF flag).

       -N nodeinfo_option
           IPv6 only. Send ICMPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620), instead
           of Echo Request. CAP_NET_RAW capability is required.

           help
               Show help for NI support.

           name
               Queries for Node Names.

           ipv6
               Queries for IPv6 Addresses. There are several IPv6 specific
               flags.

               ipv6-global
                   Request IPv6 global-scope addresses.

               ipv6-sitelocal

               ipv6-linklocal
                   Request IPv6 link-local addresses.

               ipv6-all
                   Request IPv6 addresses on other interfaces.

           ipv4
               Queries for IPv4 Addresses. There is one IPv4 specific flag.

               ipv4-all
                   Request IPv4 addresses on other interfaces.

           subject-ipv6=ipv6addr
               IPv6 subject address.

           subject-ipv4=ipv4addr
               IPv4 subject address.

           subject-name=nodename
               Subject name. If it contains more than one dot, fully-qualified
               domain name is assumed.

           subject-fqdn=nodename
               Subject name. Fully-qualified domain name is always assumed.

       -n
           Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
           names for host addresses.

       -O
           Report outstanding ICMP ECHO reply before sending next packet. This
           is useful together with the timestamp -D to log output to a
           diagnostic file and search for missing answers.

       -p pattern
           You may specify up to 16 "pad" bytes to fill out the packet you
           send. This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
           network. For example, -p ff will cause the sent packet to be filled
           with all ones.

       -q
           Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at
           startup time and when finished.

       -Q tos
           Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams.  tos can be
           decimal (ping only) or hex number.

           In RFC2474, these fields are interpreted as 8-bit Differentiated
           Services (DS), consisting of: bits 0-1 (2 lowest bits) of separate
           data, and bits 2-7 (highest 6 bits) of Differentiated Services
           Codepoint (DSCP). In RFC2481 and RFC3168, bits 0-1 are used for
           ECN.

           Historically (RFC1349, obsoleted by RFC2474), these were
           interpreted as: bit 0 (lowest bit) for reserved (currently being
           redefined as congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and bits
           5-7 (highest bits) for Precedence.

       -r
           Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an
           attached interface. If the host is not on a directly-attached
           network, an error is returned. This option can be used to ping a
           local host through an interface that has no route through it
           provided the option -I is also used.

       -R
           ping only. Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the
           ECHO_REQUEST packet and displays the route buffer on returned
           packets. Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such
           routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this option.

       -s packetsize
           Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56,
           which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8
           bytes of ICMP header data.

       -S sndbuf
           Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not
           more than one packet.

       -t ttl
           ping only. Set the IP Time to Live.

       -T timestamp option
           Set special IP timestamp options.  timestamp option may be either
           tsonly (only timestamps), tsandaddr (timestamps and addresses) or
           tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]] (timestamp prespecified
           hops).

       -U
           Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour). Normally ping
           prints network round trip time, which can be different f.e. due to
           DNS failures.

       -v
           Verbose output. Do not suppress DUP replies when pinging multicast
           address.

       -V
           Show version and exit.

       -w deadline
           Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how
           many packets have been sent or received. In this case ping does not
           stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline
           expire or until count probes are answered or for some error
           notification from network.

       -W timeout
           Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only
           timeout in absence of any responses, otherwise ping waits for two
           RTTs. Real number allowed with dot as a decimal separator
           (regardless locale setup). 0 means infinite timeout.

       When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the
       local host, to verify that the local network interface is up and

       quality.

       When the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or
       if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is
       displayed. Shorter current statistics can be obtained without
       termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.

OPTIONS:
--help Print help info and exit.

       -4, -6 Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 tracerouting. By default, the pro-
              gram  will  try to resolve the name given, and choose the appro-
              priate protocol automatically. If resolving a host name  returns
              both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, traceroute will use IPv4.

       -I, --icmp
              Use ICMP ECHO for probes

       -T, --tcp
              Use TCP SYN for probes

       -d, --debug
              Enable  socket  level  debugging (when the Linux kernel supports
              it)

       -F, --dont-fragment
              Do not fragment probe packets. (For IPv4 it also  sets  DF  bit,
              which  tells  intermediate  routers  not to fragment remotely as
              well).

              Varying the size of the probing packet by the packet_len command
              line  parameter,  you  can manually obtain information about the
              MTU of individual network hops. The  --mtu  option  (see  below)
              tries to do this automatically.

              Note, that non-fragmented features (like -F or --mtu) work prop-
              erly since the Linux kernel 2.6.22 only.  Before  that  version,
              IPv6  was always fragmented, IPv4 could use the once the discov-
              ered final mtu only (from the route cache), which  can  be  less
              than the actual mtu of a device.

       -f first_ttl, --first=first_ttl
              Specifies with what TTL to start. Defaults to 1.

       -g gateway, --gateway=gateway
              Tells  traceroute to add an IP source routing option to the out-
              going packet that tells the network to route the packet  through
              the specified gateway (most routers have disabled source routing
              for security reasons).  In general, several gateway's is allowed
              (comma  separated).  For  IPv6, the form of num,addr,addr...  is
              allowed, where num is a route header type (default is  type  2).
              Note the type 0 route header is now deprecated (rfc5095).

       -i interface, --interface=interface
              Specifies  the  interface  through  which traceroute should send
              packets. By default, the interface is selected according to  the
              routing table.

       -m max_ttl, --max-hops=max_ttl
              Specifies  the  maximum  number of hops (max time-to-live value)
              traceroute will probe. The default is 30.

       -N squeries, --sim-queries=squeries
              Specifies the number of probe packets sent  out  simultaneously.
              Sending several probes concurrently can speed up traceroute con-
              siderably. The default value is 16.
              Note that some routers and hosts can use ICMP  rate  throttling.
              In such a situation specifying too large number can lead to loss
              of some responses.

       -n     Do not try to map IP addresses to  host  names  when  displaying
              them.

       -p port, --port=port
              For  UDP tracing, specifies the destination port base traceroute
              will use (the destination port number  will  be  incremented  by
              each probe).
              For ICMP tracing, specifies the initial ICMP sequence value (in-
              cremented by each probe too).
              For TCP and others specifies  just  the  (constant)  destination
              port to connect. When using the tcptraceroute wrapper, -p speci-
              fies the source port.

       -t tos, --tos=tos
              For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS)  and  Precedence  value.
              Useful  values  are 16 (low delay) and 8 (high throughput). Note
              that in order to use some TOS precedence values, you have to  be
              super user.
              For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value.

       -l flow_label, --flowlabel=flow_label
              Use specified flow_label for IPv6 packets.

       -w max[,here,near], --wait=max[,here,near]
              Determines how long to wait for a response to a probe.

              There  are  three (in general) float values separated by a comma
              (or a slash).  Max specifies the maximum time (in  seconds,  de-
              fault 5.0) to wait, in any case.

              Traditional  traceroute  implementation  always waited whole max
              seconds for any probe. But if we already have some replies  from
              the  same  hop, or even from some next hop, we can use the round
              trip time of such a reply as a hint to determine the actual rea-
              sonable amount of time to wait.

              The  optional  here (default 3.0) specifies a factor to multiply
              the round trip time of an already  received  response  from  the
              same  hop.  The  resulting  value  is  used as a timeout for the
              probe, instead of (but no more than)  max.   The  optional  near
              (default  10.0)  specifies  a similar factor for a response from
              some next hop.  (The time of the first found result is  used  in
              both cases).

              First,  we  look  for  the  same hop (of the probe which will be
              printed first from now).  If nothing found, then look  for  some
              next  hop.  If nothing found, use max.  If here and/or near have
              zero values, the corresponding computation is skipped.
              Here and near are always set to zero if only  max  is  specified
              (for compatibility with previous versions).

       -q nqueries, --queries=nqueries
              Sets the number of probe packets per hop. The default is 3.

       -r     Bypass  the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on
              an attached network.  If the host is not on a  directly-attached
              network,  an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping
              a local host through an interface that has no route through it.

       -s source_addr, --source=source_addr
              Chooses an alternative source address. Note that you must select
              the  address  of one of the interfaces.  By default, the address
              of the outgoing interface is used.

       -z sendwait, --sendwait=sendwait
              Minimal time interval between probes (default 0).  If the  value
              is  more  than  10,  then it specifies a number in milliseconds,
              else it is a number of seconds (float point values allowed too).
              Useful when some routers use rate-limit for ICMP messages.

       -e, --extensions
              Show  ICMP extensions (rfc4884). The general form is CLASS/TYPE:
              followed by a hexadecimal dump.  The  MPLS  (rfc4950)  is  shown
              parsed,  in  a form: MPLS:L=label,E=exp_use,S=stack_bottom,T=TTL
              (more objects separated by / ).

       -A, --as-path-lookups
              Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print  results
              directly after the corresponding addresses.

       -V, --version
              Print the version and exit.

       There  are  additional options intended for advanced usage (such as al-
       ternate trace methods etc.):

       --sport=port
              Chooses the source port to use. Implies  -N 1 -w 5  .   Normally
              source ports (if applicable) are chosen by the system.

       --fwmark=mark
              Set the firewall mark for outgoing packets (since the Linux ker-
              nel 2.6.25).

       -M method, --module=name
              Use specified method for traceroute operations.  Default  tradi-
              tional  udp method has name default, icmp (-I) and tcp (-T) have
              names icmp and tcp respectively.
              Method-specific options can be passed by -O .  Most methods have
              their simple shortcuts, (-I means -M icmp, etc).

       -O option, --options=options
              Specifies some method-specific option. Several options are sepa-
              rated by comma (or use several -O on cmdline).  Each method  may
              have its own specific options, or many not have them at all.  To
              print information about available options, use -O help.

       -U, --udp
              Use UDP to particular destination port for tracerouting (instead
              of  increasing  the  port  per  each  probe). Default port is 53
              (dns).

       -UL    Use UDPLITE for tracerouting (default port is 53).

       -D, --dccp
              Use DCCP Requests for probes.

       -P protocol, --protocol=protocol
              Use raw packet of specified protocol for  tracerouting.  Default
              protocol is 253 (rfc3692).

       --mtu  Discover  MTU along the path being traced. Implies -F -N 1.  New
              mtu is printed once in a form of F=NUM at the first probe  of  a
              hop which requires such mtu to be reached. (Actually, the corre-
              spond "frag needed" icmp message normally is sent by the  previ-
              ous hop).

              Note, that some routers might cache once the seen information on
              a fragmentation. Thus you can  receive  the  final  mtu  from  a
              closer hop.  Try to specify an unusual tos by -t , this can help
              for one attempt (then it can be cached there as well).
              See -F option for more info.

       --back Print the number of backward hops when it seems  different  with
              the forward direction. This number is guessed in assumption that
              remote hops send reply packets with initial ttl  set  to  either
              64, or 128 or 255 (which seems a common practice). It is printed
              as a negate value in a form of '-NUM' .

COMMAND: dig

DESCRIPTION: dig - DNS lookup utility

USAGE: dig  [@server] [-b address] [-c class] [-f filename] [-k filename] [-m]
       [-p port#] [-q name] [-t type] [-v] [-x addr]  [-y  [hmac:]name:key]  [
       [-4] | [-6] ] [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]

       dig [-h]

       dig [global-queryopt...] [query...]

OPTIONS:
-4     This option indicates that only IPv4 should be used.

       -6     This option indicates that only IPv6 should be used.

       -b address[#port]
              This option sets the source IP address of the query. The address
              must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces,
              or  "0.0.0.0"  or "::". An optional port may be specified by ap-
              pending #port.

       -c class
              This option sets the query class. The default class is IN; other
              classes are HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records.

       -f file
              This option sets batch mode, in which dig reads a list of lookup
              requests to process from the given file. Each line in  the  file
              should  be  organized in the same way it would be presented as a
              query to dig using the command-line interface.

       -h     Print a usage summary.

       -k keyfile
              This option tells dig to sign queries using TSIG or SIG(0) using
              a key read from the given file. Key files can be generated using
              tsig-keygen. When using TSIG authentication with dig,  the  name
              server  that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that
              is being used. In BIND, this is done  by  providing  appropriate
              key  and server statements in named.conf for TSIG and by looking
              up the KEY record in zone data for SIG(0).

       -m     This option enables memory usage debugging.

       -p port
              This option sends the  query  to  a  non-standard  port  on  the
              server,  instead  of the default port 53. This option is used to
              test a name server  that  has  been  configured  to  listen  for
              queries on a non-standard port number.

       -q name
              This  option  specifies the domain name to query. This is useful
              to distinguish the name from other arguments.

       -r     This option indicates that options  from  ${HOME}/.digrc  should
              not  be  read.  This is useful for scripts that need predictable
              behavior.

       -t type
              This option indicates the resource record type to  query,  which
              can  be  any  valid  query type. If it is a resource record type
              supported in BIND 9, it can be given by the type mnemonic  (such
              as  NS  or AAAA). The default query type is A, unless the -x op-
              tion is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup. A  zone  transfer
              can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremen-
              tal zone transfer (IXFR) is required, set the  type  to  ixfr=N.
              The  incremental  zone transfer contains all changes made to the
              zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was N.

              All resource record types can be expressed as TYPEnn,  where  nn
              is  the  number  of the type. If the resource record type is not
              supported in BIND 9, the result is displayed as described in RFC
              3597.

       -u     This  option indicates that print query times should be provided
              in microseconds instead of milliseconds.

       -v     This option prints the version number and exits.

       -x addr
              This option sets simplified reverse  lookups,  for  mapping  ad-
              dresses  to names. The addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal
              notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When the -x  option
              is  used,  there is no need to provide the name, class, and type
              arguments.  dig automatically performs a lookup for a name  like
              94.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type and class to PTR
              and IN respectively. IPv6 addresses are looked up  using  nibble
              format under the IP6.ARPA domain.

       -y [hmac:]keyname:secret
              This  option signs queries using TSIG with the given authentica-
              tion key.  keyname is the name of the key,  and  secret  is  the
              base64-encoded  shared secret. hmac is the name of the key algo-
              rithm;  valid  choices  are  hmac-md5,  hmac-sha1,  hmac-sha224,
              hmac-sha256,  hmac-sha384, or hmac-sha512. If hmac is not speci-
              fied, the default is hmac-md5; if MD5 was disabled, the  default
              is hmac-sha256.

       NOTE:
          Only  the  -k  option should be used, rather than the -y option, be-
          cause with -y the shared secret is supplied as a command-line  argu-
          ment in clear text. This may be visible in the output from ps1 or in
          a history file maintained by the user's shell.

       -a     The -a ("all") option is normally equivalent to -v  -t  ANY.  It
              also affects the behavior of the -l list zone option.

       -A     The  -A  ("almost  all") option is equivalent to -a, except that
              RRSIG, NSEC, and NSEC3 records are omitted from the output.

       -c class
              This option specifies the query class,  which  can  be  used  to
              lookup  HS (Hesiod) or CH (Chaosnet) class resource records. The
              default class is IN (Internet).

       -C     This option indicates that named should check consistency, mean-
              ing that host queries the SOA records for zone name from all the
              listed authoritative name servers for that  zone.  The  list  of
              name servers is defined by the NS records that are found for the
              zone.

       -d     This option prints debugging traces, and is equivalent to the -v
              verbose option.

       -l     This  option tells named to list the zone, meaning the host com-
              mand performs a zone transfer of zone name and  prints  out  the
              NS, PTR, and address records (A/AAAA).

              Together, the -l -a options print all records in the zone.

       -N ndots
              This option specifies the number of dots (ndots) that have to be
              in name for it to be considered absolute. The default  value  is
              that defined using the ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf, or 1
              if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots are  in-
              terpreted as relative names, and are searched for in the domains
              listed in the search or domain directive in /etc/resolv.conf.

       -p port
              This option specifies the port to query on the server.  The  de-
              fault is 53.

       -r     This option specifies a non-recursive query; setting this option
              clears the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query.  This  means
              that the name server receiving the query does not attempt to re-
              solve name. The -r option enables host to mimic the behavior  of
              a  name server by making non-recursive queries, and expecting to
              receive answers to those queries that can be referrals to  other
              name servers.

       -R number
              This  option specifies the number of retries for UDP queries. If
              number is negative or zero, the number of  retries  is  silently
              set  to  1. The default value is 1, or the value of the attempts
              option in /etc/resolv.conf, if set.

       -s     This option tells named not to send the query to the next  name-
              server if any server responds with a SERVFAIL response, which is
              the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior.

       -t type
              This option specifies the query type. The type argument  can  be
              any  recognized  query  type: CNAME, NS, SOA, TXT, DNSKEY, AXFR,
              etc.

              When no query type is specified, host automatically  selects  an
              appropriate query type. By default, it looks for A, AAAA, and MX
              records. If the -C option is given, queries  are  made  for  SOA
              records.  If  name is a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-de-
              limited IPv6 address, host queries for PTR records.

              If a query type of IXFR is chosen, the  starting  serial  number
              can  be  specified  by appending an equals sign (=), followed by
              the starting serial number, e.g., -t IXFR=12345678.

       -T, -U This option specifies TCP or UDP. By default, host uses UDP when
              making queries; the -T option makes it use a TCP connection when
              querying the name server.  TCP  is  automatically  selected  for
              queries  that require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests.
              Type ANY queries default to TCP, but can be forced  to  use  UDP
              initially via -U.

       -m flag
              This option sets memory usage debugging: the flag can be record,
              usage, or trace. The -m option can be specified more  than  once
              to set multiple flags.

       -v     This option sets verbose output, and is equivalent to the -d de-
              bug option. Verbose output can also be enabled  by  setting  the
              debug option in /etc/resolv.conf.

       -V     This option prints the version number and exits.

       -w     This option sets "wait forever": the query timeout is set to the
              maximum possible. See also the -W option.

       -W wait
              This options sets the length of  the  wait  timeout,  indicating
              that  named  should  wait for up to wait seconds for a reply. If
              wait is less than 1, the wait interval is set to 1 second.

              By default, host waits for 5 seconds for UDP  responses  and  10
              seconds for TCP connections. These defaults can be overridden by
              the timeout option in /etc/resolv.conf.

              See also the -w option.

COMMAND: curl

DESCRIPTION: curl - transfer a URL

USAGE: curl [options / URLs]

OPTIONS:
Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the  options  require  an
       additional value next to them.

       The  short  "single-dash"  form  of the options, -d for example, may be
       used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space
       is a recommended separator. The long "double-dash" form, -d, --data for
       example, requires a space between it and its value.

       Short version options that do not need any  additional  values  can  be
       used  immediately  next to each other, like for example you can specify
       all the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
       disabled  with  --no-option.  That is, you use the same option name but
       prefix it with "no-". However, in this list we  mostly  only  list  and
       show the --option version of them.

       --abstract-unix-socket <path>
              (HTTP)  Connect  through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead
              of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path  of  an  ab-
              stract  socket  prefixed  with  '@', however the <path> argument
              should not have this leading character.

              If --abstract-unix-socket is provided several  times,  the  last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com

              See also --unix-socket. Added in 7.53.0.

       --alt-svc <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the
              file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be
              used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the
              file name again if it has been modified.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
              make curl just handle the cache in memory.

              If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents
              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

              --alt-svc can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com

              See also --resolve and --connect-to. Added in 7.64.1.

       --anyauth
              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
              and  use  the most secure one the remote site claims to support.
              This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
              headers,  thus  possibly  inducing  an extra network round-trip.
              This is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific  authentication
              method,  which  you  can  do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and
              --negotiate.

              Using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
              since  it  may require data to be sent twice and then the client
              must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when  uploading
              from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

              Used together with -u, --user.

              Providing --anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com

              See also --proxy-anyauth, --basic and --digest.

       -a, --append
              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the
              target file instead of overwriting it. If the remote  file  does
              not exist, it will be created. Note that this flag is ignored by
              some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

              Providing -a, --append multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-append.

              Example:
               curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/

              See also -r, --range and -C, --continue-at.

       --aws-sigv4 <provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]>
              Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.

              The  provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm
              when creating outgoing authentication headers.

              The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area
              of  a resources collection (region-code) when the region name is
              omitted from the endpoint.

              The service argument is a string that points to a function  pro-
              vided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted
              from the endpoint.

              If --aws-sigv4 is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --aws-sigv4 "aws:amz:east-2:es" --user "key:secret" https://example.com

              See also --basic and -u, --user. Added in 7.75.0.

       --basic
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the re-
              mote host. This is the default and this option is usually point-
              less, unless you use it to override a previously set option that
              sets a different authentication method (such  as  --ntlm,  --di-
              gest, or --negotiate).

              Used together with -u, --user.

              Providing --basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com

              See also --proxy-basic.

       --cacert <file>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
              the peer. The file may contain  multiple  CA  certificates.  The
              certificate(s)  must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built to
              use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
              alter that default file.

              curl  recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
              if it is set, and uses the given path as a path  to  a  CA  cert
              bundle. This option overrides that variable.

              The  windows  version  of  curl will automatically look for a CA
              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
              tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
              folder along your PATH.

              If curl is built against  the  NSS  SSL  library,  the  NSS  PEM
              PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this op-
              tion to work properly.

              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure  Transport,
              then  this  option  is supported for backward compatibility with
              other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If  the  option  is
              not  set,  then curl will use the certificates in the system and
              user Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred  method
              of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

              (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows
              7 or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is  supported
              for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is
              recommended to use Windows' store of root certificates (the  de-
              fault for Schannel).

              If  --cacert  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --cacert CA-file.txt https://example.com

              See also --capath and -k, --insecure.

       --capath <dir>
              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to
              verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating
              them with ":" (e.g.  "path1:path2:path3"). The certificates must
              be  in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the di-
              rectory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility sup-
              plied  with  OpenSSL.  Using  --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered
              curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using
              --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

              If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored.

              If  --capath  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --capath /local/directory https://example.com

              See also --cacert and -k, --insecure.

       --cert-status
              (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server  certificate
              by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
              extension.

              If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid  (e.g.
              expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-
              tificate has been revoked, or no response at  all  is  received,
              the verification fails.

              This  is  currently  only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and
              NSS backends.

              Providing --cert-status multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-cert-status.

              Example:
               curl --cert-status https://example.com

              See also --pinnedpubkey. Added in 7.41.0.

       --cert-type <type>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  what type the provided client certificate is
              using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.

              The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually  PEM,
              however  for  Secure  Transport  and  Schannel it is P12. If -E,
              --cert is a pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default type.

              If --cert-type is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --cert-type PEM --cert file https://example.com

              See also -E, --cert, --key and --key-type.

       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use the specified client certificate file
              when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-
              col.  The  certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure
              Transport, or PEM format if using any other engine. If  the  op-
              tional  password is not specified, it will be queried for on the
              terminal. Note that this option assumes a certificate file  that
              is  the private key and the client certificate concatenated. See
              -E, --cert and --key to specify them independently.

              In the <certificate> portion of the argument,  you  must  escape
              the  character  ":"  as "\:" so that it is not recognized as the
              password delimiter. Similarly, you must escape the character "\"
              as "\\" so that it is not recognized as an escape character.

              If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
              can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the
              NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
              default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
              nsspem.so) is available then PEM files may be loaded.

              If  you  provide  a  path relative to the current directory, you
              must prefix the path with "./" in order to avoid confusion  with
              an NSS database nickname.

              If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
              ify  a  certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
              ning with "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
              "pkcs11" if none was provided and the --cert-type option will be
              set as "ENG" if none was provided.

              (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
              then the certificate string can either be the name of a certifi-
              cate/private  key in the system or user keychain, or the path to
              a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If  you  want  to
              use  a  file  from the current directory, please precede it with
              "./" prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

              (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a  path
              expression  to  a  certificate  store.  (Loading PFX is not sup-
              ported; you can import it to a store first). You can use "<store
              location>\<store  name>\<thumbprint>"  to refer to a certificate
              in  the  system  certificates  store,  for   example,   "Curren-
              tUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a".   Thumbprint
              is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see  in  certificate
              details.  Following  store locations are supported: CurrentUser,
              LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,  CurrentUserGroupPolicy,
              LocalMachineGroupPolicy, LocalMachineEnterprise.

              If -E, --cert is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com

              See also --cert-type, --key and --key-type.

       --ciphers <list of ciphers>
              (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
              of  ciphers  must  specify  valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher
              list details on this URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              If --ciphers is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3.

       --compressed-ssh
              (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a request,
              not an order; the server may or may not do it.

              Providing --compressed-ssh multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-compressed-ssh.

              Example:
               curl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/

              See also --compressed. Added in 7.56.0.

       --compressed
              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
              curl supports, and automatically decompress the content. Headers
              are not modified.

              If  this  option is used and the server sends an unsupported en-
              coding, curl will report an error. This is a request, not an or-
              der; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.

              Providing --compressed multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-compressed.

              Example:
               curl --compressed https://example.com

              See also --compressed-ssh.

       -K, --config <file>
              Specify a text file to read curl  arguments  from.  The  command
              line  arguments  found  in the text file will be used as if they
              were provided on the command line.

              Options and their parameters must be specified on the same  line
              in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
              Long option names can optionally be given  in  the  config  file
              without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals
              characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified
              with  one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals charac-
              ter between the option and its parameter.

              If the parameter contains whitespace (or starts with  :  or  =),
              the  parameter  must  be  enclosed  within quotes. Within double
              quotes, the following escape sequences are  available:  \\,  \",
              \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ig-
              nored.

              If the first column of a config line is  a  '#'  character,  the
              rest of the line will be treated as a comment.

              Only write one option per physical line in the config file.

              Specify  the  filename  to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read
              the file from stdin.

              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you
              need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply
              writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to
              this:

              url = "https://curl.se/docs/"

               # --- Example file ---
               # this is a comment
               url = "example.com"
               output = "curlhere.html"
               user-agent = "superagent/1.0"

               # and fetch another URL too
               url = "example.com/docs/manpage.html"
               -O
               referer = "http://nowhereatall.example.com/"
               # --- End of example file ---

              When  curl  is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks
              for a default config file and uses it if found,  even  when  -K,
              --config  is used. The default config file is checked for in the
              following places in this order:

              1) "$CURL_HOME/.curlrc"

              2) "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.curlrc" (Added in 7.73.0)

              3) "$HOME/.curlrc"

              4) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\.curlrc"

              5) Windows: "%APPDATA%\.curlrc"

              6) Windows: "%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\.curlrc"

              7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory

              8) On Windows, if it finds no .curlrc file in the  sequence  de-
              scribed  above,  it checks for one in the same dir the curl exe-
              cutable is placed.

              On Windows two filenames are checked per location:  .curlrc  and
              _curlrc,  preferring  the  former.  Older  versions  on  Windows
              checked for _curlrc only.

              -K, --config can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --config file.txt https://example.com

              See also -q, --disable.

       --connect-timeout <fractional seconds>
              Maximum time in seconds that  you  allow  curl's  connection  to
              take.   This  only  limits the connection phase, so if curl con-
              nects within the given period it will continue - if not it  will
              exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.

              The "connection phase" is considered complete when the requested
              TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If --connect-timeout is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com
               curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com

              See also -m, --max-time.

       --connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>

              For  a  request  to  the  given  HOST1:PORT1  pair,  connect  to
              HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct requests
              at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a clus-
              ter of servers. This option is only used to establish  the  net-
              work  connection.  It  does NOT affect the hostname/port that is
              used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the
              application  protocols.  "HOST1"  and  "PORT1"  may be the empty
              string, meaning "any host/port". "HOST2" and "PORT2" may also be
              the   empty   string,   meaning   "use  the  request's  original
              host/port".

              A "host" specified to this option is compared as a string, so it
              needs  to  match  the name used in request URL. It can be either
              numerical such as "127.0.0.1" or the full host name such as "ex-
              ample.org".

              --connect-to can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com

              See also --resolve and -H, --header. Added in 7.49.0.

       -C, --continue-at <offset>
              Continue/Resume  a  previous  file transfer at the given offset.
              The given offset is the exact  number  of  bytes  that  will  be
              skipped,  counting  from the beginning of the source file before
              it is transferred to the destination. If used with uploads,  the
              FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

              Use  "-C  -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to
              resume the transfer. It then uses the given  output/input  files
              to figure that out.

              If  -C,  --continue-at  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -C - https://example.com
               curl -C 400 https://example.com

              See also -r, --range.

       -c, --cookie-jar <filename>
              (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all  cookies
              after  a  completed  operation. Curl writes all cookies from its
              in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of  opera-
              tions.  If  no  cookies  are known, no data will be written. The
              file will be written using the Netscape cookie file  format.  If
              you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the cookies will be
              written to stdout.

              This command line option will activate the  cookie  engine  that
              makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is
              to use the -b, --cookie option.

              If the cookie jar cannot be created or  written  to,  the  whole
              curl  operation  will  not fail or even report an error clearly.
              Using -v, --verbose will get a warning displayed,  but  that  is
              the  only  visible  feedback  you get about this possibly lethal
              situation.

              If -c, --cookie-jar is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com
               curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com

              See also -b, --cookie.

       -b, --cookie <data|filename>
              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It
              is supposedly the data previously received from the server in  a
              "Set-Cookie:"   line.   The   data   should  be  in  the  format
              "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2". This makes  curl  use  the  cookie
              header  with this content explicitly in all outgoing request(s).
              If multiple requests are done due  to  authentication,  followed
              redirects or similar, they will all get this cookie passed on.

              If  no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated
              as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
              also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record in-
              coming cookies, which may be handy if you are using this in com-
              bination  with  the  -L,  --location  option  or do multiple URL
              transfers on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a  mi-
              nus ("-"), curl will instead read the contents from stdin.

              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
              HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the  Netscape/Mozilla  cookie
              file format.

              The  file  specified with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No
              cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies,  use  the
              -c, --cookie-jar option.

              If  you  use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a do-
              main then the cookie is not sent since  the  domain  will  never
              match.  To  address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing
              that will include sub-domains) or preferably: use  the  Netscape
              format.

              Users  often want to both read cookies from a file and write up-
              dated cookies back to a file, so using both -b, --cookie and -c,
              --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.

              -b, --cookie can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -b cookiefile https://example.com
               curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com

              See also -c, --cookie-jar and -j, --junk-session-cookies.

       --create-dirs
              When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will
              create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This
              option  creates  the directories mentioned with the -o, --output
              option, nothing else. If the -o, --output file name uses no  di-
              rectory, or if the directories it mentions already exist, no di-
              rectories will be created.

              Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.

              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try  --ftp-
              create-dirs.

              Providing  --create-dirs  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-create-dirs.

              Example:
               curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com

              See also --ftp-create-dirs and --output-dir.

       --create-file-mode <mode>
              (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using
              one  of  the supported protocols, this option allows the user to
              set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation time, instead of
              the default 0644.

              This option takes an octal number as argument.

              If  --create-file-mode  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new

              See also --ftp-create-dirs. Added in 7.75.0.

       --crlf (FTP SMTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in  upload.  Useful  for  MVS
              (OS/390).

              (SMTP added in 7.40.0)

              Providing --crlf multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it
              again with --no-crlf.

              Example:
               curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/

              See also -B, --use-ascii.

       --crlfile <file>
              (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revoca-
              tion List that may specify peer certificates that are to be con-
              sidered revoked.

              If --crlfile is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com

              See also --cacert and --capath.

       --curves <algorithm list>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to request specific curves to use during SSL
              session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.  Multiple  al-
              gorithms  can  be  provided  by  separating  them with ":" (e.g.
              "X25519:P-521").  The parameter is available identically in  the
              "openssl s_client/s_server" utilities.

              --curves  allows  a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL-connections
              with exactly the (EC) curve requested by  the  client,  avoiding
              nontransparent client/server negotiations.

              If  this  option  is  set,  the  default  curves list built into
              openssl will be ignored.

              If --curves is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --curves X25519 https://example.com

       --data-ascii <data>
              (HTTP) This is just an alias for -d, --data.

              --data-ascii can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --data-ascii @file https://example.com

              See also --data-binary, --data-raw and --data-urlencode.

       --data-binary <data>
              (HTTP)  This  posts data exactly as specified with no extra pro-
              cessing whatsoever.

              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
              filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as -d, --data does,
              except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and con-
              versions are never done.

              Like  -d,  --data the default content-type sent to the server is
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the  data  to  be
              treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the con-
              tent-type to octet-stream: -H "Content-Type:  application/octet-
              stream".

              If  this  option  is  used several times, the ones following the
              first will append data as described in -d, --data.

              --data-binary can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --data-binary @filename https://example.com

              See also --data-ascii.

       --data-raw <data>
              (HTTP) This posts data similarly to -d, --data but  without  the
              special interpretation of the @ character.

              --data-raw can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --data-raw "hello" https://example.com
               curl --data-raw "@at@at@" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data. Added in 7.43.0.

       --data-urlencode <data>
              (HTTP)  This posts data, similar to the other -d, --data options
              with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.

              To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin  with  a  name
              followed  by a separator and a content specification. The <data>
              part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

              content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                     on.  Just be careful so that the content does not contain
                     any = or @ symbols, as that will  then  make  the  syntax
                     match one of the other cases below!

              =content
                     This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                     on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

              name=content
                     This will make curl URL-encode the content part and  pass
                     that  on.  Note that the name part is expected to be URL-
                     encoded already.

              @filename
                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-
                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it
                     on in the POST.

              name@filename
                     This will make curl load data from the  given  file  (in-
                     cluding  any  newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it
                     on in the POST. The name part  gets  an  equal  sign  ap-
                     pended,  resulting  in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note
                     that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

       --data-urlencode can be used several times in a command line

       Examples:
        curl --data-urlencode name=val https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode =encodethis https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode name@file https://example.com
        curl --data-urlencode @fileonly https://example.com

       See also -d, --data and --data-raw.

       -d, --data <data>
              (HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST  request  to  the
              HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has
              filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This  will
              cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F, --form.

              --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special inter-
              pretation  of  the  @ character. To post data purely binary, you
              should instead use the --data-binary option. To  URL-encode  the
              value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

              If  any of these options is used more than once on the same com-
              mand line, the data pieces specified will be merged with a sepa-
              rating  &-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'
              would    generate    a    post    chunk    that    looks    like
              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl  to  read
              the  data  from  stdin.  Posting data from a file named 'foobar'
              would thus be done with -d, --data @foobar. When -d,  --data  is
              told  to  read  from a file like that, carriage returns and new-
              lines will be stripped out. If you do not want the  @  character
              to have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.

              -d, --data can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -d "name=curl" https://example.com
               curl -d "name=curl" -d "tool=cmdline" https://example.com
               curl -d @filename https://example.com

              See  also  --data-binary,  --data-urlencode and --data-raw. This
              option is mutually exclusive to -F, --form and  -I,  --head  and
              -T, --upload-file.

       --delegation <LEVEL>
              (GSS/kerberos)  Set  LEVEL to tell the server what it is allowed
              to delegate when it comes to user credentials.

              none   Do not allow any delegation.

              policy Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag  is  set
                     in  the  Kerberos  service  ticket,  which is a matter of
                     realm policy.

              always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       If --delegation is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
       used.

       Example:
        curl --delegation "none" https://example.com

       See also -k, --insecure and --ssl.

       --digest
              (HTTP)  Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authenti-
              cation scheme that prevents the password from  being  sent  over
              the  wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal
              -u, --user option to set user name and password.

              Providing --digest multiple times has no extra effect.   Disable
              it again with --no-digest.

              Example:
               curl -u name:password --digest https://example.com

              See  also  -u, --user, --proxy-digest and --anyauth. This option
              is mutually exclusive to --basic and --ntlm and --negotiate.

       --disable-eprt
              (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
              when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
              attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with  this
              option,  it  will  use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten-
              sions to the original FTP protocol, and  may  not  work  on  all
              servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
              the traditional PORT command.

              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt
              is an alias for --disable-eprt.

              If  the  server is accessed using IPv6, this option will have no
              effect as EPRT is necessary then.

              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
              switch  to  passive  mode  you need to not use -P, --ftp-port or
              force it with --ftp-pasv.

              Providing --disable-eprt multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable-eprt.

              Example:
               curl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-epsv and -P, --ftp-port.

       --disable-epsv
              (FTP)  Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when do-
              ing passive FTP transfers. Curl will normally always  first  at-
              tempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not
              try using EPSV.

              --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
              is an alias for --disable-epsv.

              If  the  server is an IPv6 host, this option will have no effect
              as EPSV is necessary then.

              Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
              switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.

              Providing  --disable-epsv  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable-epsv.

              Example:
               curl --disable-epsv ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-eprt and -P, --ftp-port.

       -q, --disable
              If used as the first parameter on the command line,  the  curlrc
              config  file will not be read and used. See the -K, --config for
              details on the default config file search path.

              Providing -q, --disable multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-disable.

              Example:
               curl -q https://example.com

              See also -K, --config.

       --disallow-username-in-url
              (HTTP)  This  tells  curl  to  exit if passed a URL containing a
              username. This is probably most useful when  the  URL  is  being
              provided at runtime or similar.

              Providing --disallow-username-in-url multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-disallow-username-in-url.

              Example:
               curl --disallow-username-in-url https://example.com

              See also --proto. Added in 7.61.0.

       --dns-interface <interface>
              (DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS  requests  through  <inter-
              face>.  This  option is a counterpart to --interface (which does
              not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an  interface  name
              (not an address).

              If --dns-interface is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also --dns-ipv4-addr  and  --dns-ipv6-addr.  --dns-interface
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv4-addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv4 DNS re-
              quests,  so  that  the DNS requests originate from this address.
              The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

              If --dns-ipv4-addr is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3 https://example.com

              See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-ipv4-addr
              requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-ipv6-addr <address>
              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to <ip-address> when making IPv6 DNS re-
              quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
              The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

              If --dns-ipv6-addr is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-ipv6-addr 2a04:4e42::561 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface  and  --dns-ipv4-addr.  --dns-ipv6-addr
              requires  that  the  underlying  libcurl was built to support c-
              ares. Added in 7.33.0.

       --dns-servers <addresses>
              Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system de-
              fault.   The  list of IP addresses should be separated with com-
              mas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as :<port-number>
              after each IP address.

              If  --dns-servers  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dns-servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface and --dns-ipv4-addr. --dns-servers  re-
              quires  that the underlying libcurl was built to support c-ares.
              Added in 7.33.0.

       --doh-cert-status
              Same as --cert-status but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

              Providing --doh-cert-status multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-doh-cert-status.

              Example:
               curl --doh-cert-status --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh-insecure
              Same as -k, --insecure but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

              Providing  --doh-insecure  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-doh-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --doh-insecure --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-url. Added in 7.76.0.

       --doh-url <URL>
              Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to  use  to  resolve
              hostnames, instead of using the default name resolver mechanism.
              The URL must be HTTPS.

              Some SSL options that you set for your transfer  will  apply  to
              DoH  since  the  name  lookups take place over SSL. However, the
              certificate verification settings are not inherited and  can  be
              controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status.

              This  option  is unset if an empty string "" is used as the URL.
              (Added in 7.85.0)

              If --doh-url is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

              See also --doh-insecure. Added in 7.62.0.

       -D, --dump-header <filename>
              (HTTP  FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the specified
              file. If no headers are received, the use of  this  option  will
              create an empty file.

              When  used  in FTP, the FTP server response lines are considered
              being "headers" and thus are saved there.

              Having multiple transfers in one set  of  operations  (i.e.  the
              URLs  in  one  -:,  --next clause), will append them to the same
              file, separated by a blank line.

              If -D, --dump-header is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --dump-header store.txt https://example.com

              See also -o, --output.

       --egd-file <file>
              (TLS)  Deprecated  option.  This option is ignored by curl since
              7.84.0. Prior to that it only had an effect on curl if built  to
              use old versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify  the  path  name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket.
              The socket is used to seed the random  engine  for  SSL  connec-
              tions.

              If --egd-file is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --egd-file /random/here https://example.com

              See also --random-file.

       --engine <name>
              (TLS) Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher  opera-
              tions. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time supported
              engines. Note that not all (and possibly none)  of  the  engines
              may be available at runtime.

              If  --engine  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --engine flavor https://example.com

              See also --ciphers and --curves.

       --etag-compare <file>
              (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the spe-
              cific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom If-None-
              Match header using the stored ETag.

              For correct results, make sure that the specified file  contains
              only  a  single  line  with  the  desired ETag. An empty file is
              parsed as an empty ETag.

              Use the option --etag-save to first save the  ETag  from  a  re-
              sponse,  and  then  use this option to compare against the saved
              ETag in a subsequent request.

              If --etag-compare is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --etag-compare etag.txt https://example.com

              See also --etag-save and -z, --time-cond. Added in 7.68.0.

       --etag-save <file>
              (HTTP)  This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified file. An
              ETag is a caching related header,  usually  returned  in  a  re-
              sponse.

              If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.

              If  --etag-save  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --etag-save storetag.txt https://example.com

              See also --etag-compare. Added in 7.68.0.

       --expect100-timeout <seconds>
              (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
              100-continue  response  when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue
              header in its request. By default curl  will  wait  one  second.
              This  option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting, it
              will continue as if the response has been received.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If --expect100-timeout is provided several times, the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file https://example.com

              See also --connect-timeout. Added in 7.47.0.

       --fail-early
              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

              When  curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line,
              it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By de-
              fault,  it  will  ignore errors if there are more URLs given and
              the last URL's success will determine the error  code  curl  re-
              turns. So early failures will be "hidden" by subsequent success-
              ful transfers.

              Using this option, curl will instead  return  an  error  on  the
              first  transfer  that  fails,  independent of the amount of URLs
              that are given on the command line. This way, no transfer  fail-
              ures go undetected by scripts and similar.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to
              fail  due  to the server's HTTP status code. You can combine the
              two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is there-
              fore contained by -:, --next.

              Providing --fail-early multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-fail-early.

              Example:
               curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example

              See also -f, --fail and --fail-with-body. Added in 7.52.0.

       --fail-with-body
              (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP  response
              code  is  400  or  greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server
              fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating
              so  (which  often  also  describes why and more). This flag will
              still allow curl to output and save that content but also to re-
              turn error 22.

              This  is  an  alternative  option to -f, --fail which makes curl
              fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.

              Providing --fail-with-body multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.

              Example:
               curl --fail-with-body https://example.com

              See  also  -f,  --fail. This option is mutually exclusive to -f,
              --fail. Added in 7.76.0.

       -f, --fail
              (HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors. This is
              useful  to  enable  scripts and users to better deal with failed
              attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a
              document,  it  returns  an HTML document stating so (which often
              also describes why and more). This flag will prevent  curl  from
              outputting that and return error 22.

              This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
              successful response codes will slip through, especially when au-
              thentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

              Providing  -f,  --fail multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-fail.

              Example:
               curl --fail https://example.com

              See also --fail-with-body. This option is mutually exclusive  to
              --fail-with-body.

       --false-start
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use false start during the TLS handshake.
              False start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending  ap-
              plication  data  before verifying the server's Finished message,
              thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

              This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure  Trans-
              port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.

              Providing  --false-start  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-false-start.

              Example:
               curl --false-start https://example.com

              See also --tcp-fastopen. Added in 7.42.0.

       --form-escape
              (HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields  and
              files using backslash-escaping instead of percent-encoding.

              If  --form-escape  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --form-escape -F 'field\name=curl' -F 'file=@load"this' https://example.com

              See also -F, --form. Added in 7.81.0.

       --form-string <name=string>
              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to -F, --form  except  that  the  value
              string  for  the  named parameter is used literally. Leading '@'
              and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no
              special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there's
              any possibility that the string value may  accidentally  trigger
              the '@' or '<' features of -F, --form.

              --form-string can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --form-string "data" https://example.com

              See also -F, --form.

       -F, --form <name=content>
              (HTTP  SMTP  IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emu-
              late a filled-in form in which a user  has  pressed  the  submit
              button.  This  causes  curl  to POST data using the Content-Type
              multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.

              For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a mul-
              tipart mail message to transmit.

              This  enables  uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'con-
              tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
              just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
              the symbol <. The difference between @ and  <  is  then  that  @
              makes  a  file  get attached in the post as a file upload, while
              the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
              field from a file.

              Tell  curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by using
              - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs. When stdin
              is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to de-
              termine its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a  part's
              data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or sim-
              ilar) is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be  ef-
              fectively  read at transmission time; since the full size is un-
              known before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by
              HTTP and rejected by IMAP.

              Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the
              name of the form-field to which the file  portrait.jpg  will  be
              the input:

               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

              Example:  send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the
              server:

               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/

              Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send  it
              as  a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local
              file:

               curl -F "story=<hugefile.txt" https://example.com/

              You can also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use  by  using
              'type=', in a manner similar to:

               curl -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" example.com

              or

               curl -F "name=daniel;type=text/foo" example.com

              You  can  also explicitly change the name field of a file upload
              part by setting filename=, like this:

               curl -F "file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost" example.com

              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by  dou-
              ble-quotes like:

               curl -F "file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"" example.com

              or

               curl -F 'file=@"local,file";filename="name;in;post"' example.com

              Note  that  if  a  filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any
              double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
              backslash.

              Quoting  must  also  be  applied to non-file data if it contains
              semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:

               curl -F 'colors="red; green; blue";type=text/x-myapp' example.com

              You can add custom headers to the  field  by  setting  headers=,
              like

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=\"X-submit-type: OK\"" example.com

              or

                curl -F "submit=OK;headers=@headerfile" example.com

              The  headers=  keyword may appear more that once and above notes
              about quoting apply. When headers are read from  a  file,  Empty
              lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each
              header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting
              the  continuation  line  with a space; embedded carriage-returns
              and trailing spaces are stripped.   Here  is  an  example  of  a
              header file contents:

                # This file contain two headers.
                X-header-1: this is a header

                # The following header is folded.
                X-header-2: this is
                 another header

              To  support  sending  multipart mail messages, the syntax is ex-
              tended as follows:
              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character  of
              the argument,
              -  if  data  starts with '(', this signals to start a new multi-
              part: it can be followed by a content type specification.
              - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.

              Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email consist-
              ing in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and
              HTML. It attaches a text file:

               curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
                    -F '=plain text message' \
                    -F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \
                    -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com

              Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=.  Available  en-
              codings are binary and 8bit that do nothing else than adding the
              corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, 7bit  that  only
              rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error, quoted-printable
              and base64 that encodes  data  according  to  the  corresponding
              schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.

              Example:  send  multipart mail with a quoted-printable text mes-
              sage and a base64 attached file:

               curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \
                    -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com

              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

              -F, --form can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --form "name=curl" --form "file=@loadthis" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data, --form-string and --form-escape.  This  op-
              tion  is mutually exclusive to -d, --data and -I, --head and -T,
              --upload-file.

       --ftp-account <data>
              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for "account data" after user name
              and  password has been provided, this data is sent off using the
              ACCT command.

              If --ftp-account is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-account "mr.robot" ftp://example.com/

              See also -u, --user.

       --ftp-alternative-to-user <command>
              (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
              send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
              Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
              "SITE AUTH" will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
              the certificate.

              If --ftp-alternative-to-user is provided several times, the last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-alternative-to-user "U53r" ftp://example.com

              See also --ftp-account and -u, --user.

       --ftp-create-dirs
              (FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses  a  path  that
              does not currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of
              curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
              create missing directories.

              Providing  --ftp-create-dirs multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-create-dirs.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file

              See also --create-dirs.

       --ftp-method <method>
              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an
              FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-
              ing alternatives:

              multicwd
                     curl does a single CWD operation for each  path  part  in
                     the  given URL. For deep hierarchies this means many com-
                     mands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be done.  This
                     is the default but the slowest behavior.

              nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR
                     etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-
                     mands. This is the fastest behavior.

              singlecwd
                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
                     operates on the file "normally"  (like  in  the  multicwd
                     case).  This  is  somewhat  more standards compliant than
                     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

       If --ftp-method is provided several times, the last set value  will  be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
        curl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
        curl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file

       See also -l, --list-only.

       --ftp-pasv
              (FTP)  Use  passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the
              internal default behavior, but using this option can be used  to
              override a previous -P, --ftp-port option.

              Reversing  an enforced passive really is not doable but you must
              then instead enforce the correct -P, --ftp-port again.

              Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
              then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.

              Providing  --ftp-pasv  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ftp-pasv.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/

              See also --disable-epsv.

       -P, --ftp-port <address>
              (FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener  roles  when  con-
              necting  with  FTP. This option makes curl use active mode. curl
              then tells the server to connect back to the client's  specified
              address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an
              IP address and port for it to connect to.  <address>  should  be
              one of:

              interface
                     e.g.  "eth0"  to specify which interface's IP address you
                     want to use (Unix only)

              IP address
                     e.g. "192.168.10.1" to specify the exact IP address

              host name
                     e.g. "my.host.domain" to specify the machine

              -      make curl pick the same IP address that is  already  used
                     for the control connection

       Disable the use of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the
       EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really
       PORT++.

       You  can  also  append ":[start]-[end]" to the right of the address, to
       tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means  you  specify  a  port
       range,  from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as well,
       but do note that it increases the risk of failure since  the  port  may
       not be available.

       If -P, --ftp-port is provided several times, the last set value will be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl -P - ftp:/example.com
        curl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com
        curl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com

       See also --ftp-pasv and --disable-eprt.

       --ftp-pret
              (FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV  (and  EPSV).
              Certain  FTP  servers,  mainly drftpd, require this non-standard
              command for directory listings as well as up  and  downloads  in
              PASV mode.

              Providing  --ftp-pret  multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ftp-pret.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/

              See also -P, --ftp-port and --ftp-pasv.

       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in
              its  response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data
              connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it  al-
              ready uses for the control connection.

              Since curl 7.74.0 this option is enabled by default.

              This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead
              of PASV.

              Providing --ftp-skip-pasv-ip multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-skip-pasv-ip ftp://example.com/

              See also --ftp-pasv.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode <active/passive>
              (FTP)  Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the
              shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not
              reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates
              the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode active --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also --ftp-ssl-ccc.

       --ftp-ssl-ccc
              (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
              layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
              munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
              low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-ccc multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-ccc.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

              See also --ssl and --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode.

       --ftp-ssl-control
              (FTP)  Require  SSL/TLS  for  the FTP login, clear for transfer.
              Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted  data  transfers
              for  efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server does not sup-
              port SSL/TLS.

              Providing --ftp-ssl-control multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ftp-ssl-control.

              Example:
               curl --ftp-ssl-control ftp://example.com

              See also --ssl.

       -G, --get
              When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with -d,
              --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in an  HTTP
              GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
              used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.

              If used in combination with -I, --head, the POST data  will  in-
              stead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

              Providing -G, --get multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-get.

              Examples:
               curl --get https://example.com
               curl --get -d "tool=curl" -d "age=old" https://example.com
               curl --get -I -d "tool=curl" https://example.com

              See also -d, --data and -X, --request.

       -g, --globoff
              This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set
              this  option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[]
              without having curl itself interpret them. Note that these  let-
              ters  are  not  normal legal URL contents but they should be en-
              coded according to the URI standard.

              Providing -g, --globoff multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-globoff.

              Example:
               curl -g "https://example.com/{[]}}}}"

              See also -K, --config and -q, --disable.

       --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms <milliseconds>
              Happy  Eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both
              IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for  dual-stack  hosts,  giving  IPv6  a
              head-start  of the specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6
              address cannot be connected to within that time, then a  connec-
              tion  attempt is made to the IPv4 address in parallel. The first
              connection to be established is the one that is used.

              The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy  Eyeballs
              RFC  6555  says  "It  is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be
              paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against  network
              load."  libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome
              currently default to 300 ms.

              If --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms is provided  several  times,  the
              last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms 500 https://example.com

              See also -m, --max-time and --connect-timeout. Added in 7.59.0.

       --haproxy-protocol
              (HTTP)  Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the beginning
              of the connection. This is used by some load balancers  and  re-
              verse proxies to indicate the client's true IP address and port.

              This  option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a
              service that expects this header.

              Providing --haproxy-protocol multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-haproxy-protocol.

              Example:
               curl --haproxy-protocol https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.60.0.

       -I, --head
              (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
              command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a
              document.  When  used  on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the
              file size and last modification time only.

              Providing -I, --head multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-head.

              Example:
               curl -I https://example.com

              See also -G, --get, -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

       -H, --header <header/@file>
              (HTTP  IMAP  SMTP)  Extra header to include in information sent.
              When used within an HTTP request, it is added to the regular re-
              quest headers.

              For an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with -F, --form op-
              tions, it is prepended to the resulting  MIME  document,  effec-
              tively including it at the mail global level. It does not affect
              raw uploaded mails (Added in 7.56.0).

              You may specify any number of extra headers. Note  that  if  you
              should  add a custom header that has the same name as one of the
              internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be
              used  instead of the internal one.  This allows you to make even
              trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should  not  re-
              place internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what
              you are doing. Remove an internal header by giving a replacement
              without  content  on  the  right  side  of  the colon, as in: -H
              "Host:". If you send the custom header with  no-value  then  its
              header  must  be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H "X-Cus-
              tom-Header;" to send "X-Custom-Header:".

              curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              This  option can take an argument in @filename style, which then
              adds a header for each line in the input  file.  Using  @-  will
              make curl read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.

              Please note that most anti-spam utilities check the presence and
              value of several MIME mail headers: these  are  "From:",  "To:",
              "Date:"  and  "Subject:"  among  others and should be added with
              this option.

              You need --proxy-header to send custom headers intended  for  an
              HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

              Passing  on  a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header when doing an
              HTTP request with a request body, will make curl send  the  data
              using chunked encoding.

              WARNING:  headers  set  with this option will be set in all HTTP
              requests - even after redirects are  followed,  like  when  told
              with  -L,  --location. This can lead to the header being sent to
              other hosts than the original host, so sensitive headers  should
              be used with caution combined with following redirects.

              -H, --header can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -H "X-First-Name: Joe" https://example.com
               curl -H "User-Agent: yes-please/2000" https://example.com
               curl -H "Host:" https://example.com
               curl -H @headers.txt https://example.com

              See also -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer.

       -h, --help <category>
              Usage  help.  This  lists all commands of the <category>.  If no
              arg was provided, curl will display the most  important  command
              line  arguments.   If the argument "all" was provided, curl will
              display all options available.  If the argument  "category"  was
              provided, curl will display all categories and their meanings.

              Example:
               curl --help all

              See also -v, --verbose.

       --hostpubmd5 <md5>
              (SFTP  SCP)  Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal digits. The
              string should be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the  remote  host's
              public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless
              the md5sums match.

              If --hostpubmd5 is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/

              See also --hostpubsha256.

       --hostpubsha256 <sha256>
              (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing a Base64-encoded SHA256 hash
              of the remote host's public key. Curl will refuse the connection
              with the host unless the hashes match.

              This  feature requires libcurl to be built with libssh2 and does
              not work with other SSH backends.

              If --hostpubsha256 is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --hostpubsha256 NDVkMTQxMGQ1ODdmMjQ3MjczYjAyOTY5MmRkMjVmNDQ= sftp://example.com/

              See also --hostpubmd5. Added in 7.80.0.

       --hsts <file name>
              (HTTPS)  This  option enables HSTS for the transfer. If the file
              name points to an existing HSTS cache file, that will  be  used.
              After  a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file
              name again if it has been modified.

              If curl is told to use HTTP:// for a transfer involving  a  host
              name  that exists in the HSTS cache, it upgrades the transfer to
              use HTTPS. Each HSTS cache entry has an individual life time af-
              ter which the upgrade is no longer performed.

              Specify a "" file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
              make curl just handle HSTS in memory.

              If this option is used several times, curl  will  load  contents
              from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

              --hsts can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --hsts cache.txt https://example.com

              See also --proto. Added in 7.74.0.

       --http0.9
              (HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9 response.

              HTTP/0.9  is  a completely headerless response and therefore you
              can also connect with this to non-HTTP servers and still  get  a
              response since curl will simply transparently downgrade - if al-
              lowed.

              Since curl 7.66.0, HTTP/0.9 is disabled by default.

              Providing --http0.9 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-http0.9.

              Example:
               curl --http0.9 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1, --http2 and --http3. Added in 7.64.0.

       -0, --http1.0
              (HTTP)  Tells  curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its
              internally preferred HTTP version.

              Providing -0, --http1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http1.0 https://example.com

              See also --http0.9 and --http1.1. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive  to  --http1.1  and --http2 and --http2-prior-knowledge and
              --http3.

       --http1.1
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

              Providing --http1.1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http1.1 https://example.com

              See also -0, --http1.0 and --http0.9. This  option  is  mutually
              exclusive  to -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and --http2-prior-knowl-
              edge and --http3. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http2-prior-knowledge
              (HTTP) Tells curl to  issue  its  non-TLS  HTTP  requests  using
              HTTP/2  without  HTTP/1.1  Upgrade.  It requires prior knowledge
              that the server supports HTTP/2 straight  away.  HTTPS  requests
              will  still  do HTTP/2 the standard way with negotiated protocol
              version in the TLS handshake.

              Providing --http2-prior-knowledge multiple times  has  no  extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-http2-prior-knowledge.

              Example:
               curl --http2-prior-knowledge https://example.com

              See  also  --http2 and --http3. --http2-prior-knowledge requires
              that the underlying libcurl was built to  support  HTTP/2.  This
              option  is mutually exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and
              --http2 and --http3. Added in 7.49.0.

       --http2
              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

              For HTTPS, this means curl will attempt to negotiate  HTTP/2  in
              the TLS handshake. curl does this by default.

              For HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to
              HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request header.

              When curl uses HTTP/2 over HTTPS, it does not itself  insist  on
              TLS 1.2 or higher even though that is required by the specifica-
              tion. A user can add this version requirement with --tlsv1.2.

              Providing --http2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http2 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http3. --http2 requires that the under-
              lying  libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. This option is mutu-
              ally exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2-prior-
              knowledge and --http3. Added in 7.33.0.

       --http3-only
              (HTTP)  **WARNING**:  this option is experimental. Do not use in
              production.

              Instructs curl to use HTTP/3 to the host in  the  URL,  with  no
              fallback  to  earlier HTTP versions. HTTP/3 can only be used for
              HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs. For HTTP, this option will  trigger
              an error.

              This  option  allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc method of
              upgrading to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks  HTTP/3
              on the given host and port.

              This  option  will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be
              established, it will not attempt any other HTTP version  on  its
              own. Use --http3 for similar functionality with a fallback.

              Providing --http3-only multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http3-only https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1, --http2 and --http3. --http3-only requires
              that the underlying libcurl was built to  support  HTTP/3.  This
              option  is mutually exclusive to --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and
              --http2  and  --http2-prior-knowledge  and  --http3.  Added   in
              7.88.0.

       --http3
              (HTTP)  **WARNING**:  this option is experimental. Do not use in
              production.

              Tells curl to try HTTP/3 to the host in the URL, but fallback to
              earlier  HTTP  versions  if  the HTTP/3 connection establishment
              fails. HTTP/3 is only available for HTTPS and not for HTTP URLs.

              This option allows a user to avoid using the Alt-Svc  method  of
              upgrading  to HTTP/3 when you know that the target speaks HTTP/3
              on the given host and port.

              When asked to use HTTP/3, curl will issue a separate attempt  to
              use  older  HTTP  versions with a slight delay, so if the HTTP/3
              transfer fails or is very slow, curl will still try  to  proceed
              with an older HTTP version.

              Use --http3-only for similar functionality without a fallback.

              Providing --http3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --http3 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. --http3 requires that the under-
              lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/3. This option is  mutu-
              ally  exclusive  to  --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and
              --http2-prior-knowledge and --http3-only. Added in 7.66.0.

       --ignore-content-length
              (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is
              particularly  useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will
              report incorrect Content-Length for files larger  than  2  giga-
              bytes.

              For  FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the
              size before downloading a file.

              This option does not work for HTTP if libcurl was built  to  use
              hyper.

              Providing  --ignore-content-length  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ignore-content-length.

              Example:
               curl --ignore-content-length https://example.com

              See also --ftp-skip-pasv-ip.

       -i, --include
              Include the HTTP response headers in the output.  The  HTTP  re-
              sponse  headers  can  include  things like server name, cookies,
              date of the document, HTTP version and more...

              To view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.

              Providing -i, --include multiple  times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-include.

              Example:
               curl -i https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose.

       -k, --insecure
              (TLS SFTP SCP) By default, every secure connection curl makes is
              verified to be secure before the transfer takes place. This  op-
              tion  makes  curl skip the verification step and proceed without
              checking.

              When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl veri-
              fies  the server's TLS certificate before it continues: that the
              certificate contains the right name which matches the host  name
              used in the URL and that the certificate has been signed by a CA
              certificate present in the cert store.  See this online resource
              for further details:
               https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

              For  SFTP  and  SCP, this option makes curl skip the known_hosts
              verification.  known_hosts is a  file  normally  stored  in  the
              user's home directory in the ".ssh" subdirectory, which contains
              host names and their public keys.

              WARNING: using this option makes the transfer insecure.

              When curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses  and  allows
              for  example  HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be stored and used
              subsequently. Using -k, --insecure can make curl trust  and  use
              such information from malicious servers.

              Providing  -k,  --insecure  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --insecure https://example.com

              See also --proxy-insecure, --cacert and --capath.

       --interface <name>
              Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can  enter
              interface  name,  IP address or host name. An example could look
              like:

               curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

              On Linux it can be used to specify a VRF, but the  binary  needs
              to  either  have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root. More informa-
              tion  about  Linux  VRF:   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documenta-
              tion/networking/vrf.txt

              If  --interface  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --interface eth0 https://example.com

              See also --dns-interface.

       -4, --ipv4
              This option tells curl to use IPv4 addresses only, and  not  for
              example try IPv6.

              Providing  -4,  --ipv4 multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-ipv4.

              Example:
               curl --ipv4 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. This option is  mutually  exclu-
              sive to -6, --ipv6.

       -6, --ipv6
              This  option  tells curl to use IPv6 addresses only, and not for
              example try IPv4.

              Providing -6, --ipv6 multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-ipv6.

              Example:
               curl --ipv6 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1 and --http2. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to -4, --ipv4.

       --json <data>
              (HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST  request  to  the
              HTTP  server.  --json  works  as a shortcut for passing on these
              three options:

               --data [arg]
               --header "Content-Type: application/json"
               --header "Accept: application/json"

              There is no verification that the passed in data is actual  JSON
              or that the syntax is correct.

              If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
              file name to read the data from, or a single  dash  (-)  if  you
              want  curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file
              named 'foobar' would thus be done with --json @foobar and to in-
              stead read the data from stdin, use --json @-.

              If  this option is used more than once on the same command line,
              the additional data pieces will be concatenated to the  previous
              before sending.

              The headers this option sets can be overridden with -H, --header
              as usual.

              --json can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --json '{ "drink": "coffe" }' https://example.com
               curl --json '{ "drink":' --json ' "coffe" }' https://example.com
               curl --json @prepared https://example.com
               curl --json @- https://example.com < json.txt

              See also --data-binary and --data-raw. This option  is  mutually
              exclusive  to  -F,  --form and -I, --head and -T, --upload-file.
              Added in 7.82.0.

       -j, --junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
              option will make it discard all "session cookies". This will ba-
              sically have the same effect as if a  new  session  is  started.
              Typical  browsers  always  discard session cookies when they are
              closed down.

              Providing -j, --junk-session-cookies multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-junk-session-cookies.

              Example:
               curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt https://example.com

              See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.

       --keepalive-time <seconds>
              This  option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle be-
              fore sending keepalive probes and the  time  between  individual
              keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
              offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
              (meaning  Linux,  recent  AIX,  HP-UX and more).  Keepalives are
              used by the TCP stack to detect broken networks on idle  connec-
              tions.  The  number  of missed keepalive probes before declaring
              the connection down is OS dependent and is  commonly  9  or  10.
              This option has no effect if --no-keepalive is used.

              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

              If  --keepalive-time  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --keepalive-time 20 https://example.com

              See also --no-keepalive and -m, --max-time.

       --key-type <type>
              (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your --key  pro-
              vided  private  key  is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not
              specified, PEM is assumed.

              If --key-type is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --key-type DER --key here https://example.com

              See also --key.

       --key <key>
              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
              vate key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified,  curl
              tries   the  following  candidates  in  order:  '~/.ssh/id_rsa',
              '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.

              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine  pkcs11
              is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
              ify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A  string  begin-
              ning  with  "pkcs11:" will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a
              PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
              "pkcs11"  if none was provided and the --key-type option will be
              set as "ENG" if none was provided.

              If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then  this
              option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc). Those backends
              expect the private key to be already present in the keychain  or
              PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.

              If  --key  is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com

              See also --key-type and -E, --cert.

       --krb <level>
              (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must  be
              entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
              'private'. Should you use a level that  is  not  one  of  these,
              'private' will instead be used.

              If  --krb  is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/

              See also --delegation and --ssl. --krb requires that the  under-
              lying libcurl was built to support Kerberos.

       --libcurl <file>
              Append  this  option  to any ordinary curl command line, and you
              will get libcurl-using C source code written to  the  file  that
              does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --libcurl is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose.

       --limit-rate <speed>
              Specify  the  maximum  transfer  rate you want curl to use - for
              both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a
              limited  pipe  and  you would like your transfer not to use your
              entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.

              The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is
              appended.   Appending  'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilo-
              bytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes  it
              gigabytes.  The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For ex-
              ample 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

              The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed to
              no  more  than  the set threshold over a period of multiple sec-
              onds.

              If you also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that  option  will
              take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to
              help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

              If --limit-rate is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com
               curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com
               curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com

              See also --rate, -Y, --speed-limit and -y, --speed-time.

       -l, --list-only
              (FTP  POP3)  (FTP)  When  listing  an FTP directory, this switch
              forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if  the  user
              wants  to  machine-parse  the contents of an FTP directory since
              the normal directory view does not use a standard look  or  for-
              mat.  When  used like this, the option causes an NLST command to
              be sent to the server instead of LIST.

              Note: Some FTP servers list only  files  in  their  response  to
              NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.

              (POP3)  When  retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch
              forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR.  This  is
              particularly  useful if the user wants to see if a specific mes-
              sage-id exists on the server and what size it is.

              Note: When combined with -X, --request, this option can be  used
              to  send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's
              unique identifier rather than its message-id  to  make  the  re-
              quest.

              Providing  -l,  --list-only  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-list-only.

              Example:
               curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/

              See also -Q, --quote and -X, --request.

       --local-port <num/range>
              Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of  local  port
              numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by
              nature are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so  set-
              ting  this range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary
              connection setup failures.

              If --local-port is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com

              See also -g, --globoff.

       --location-trusted
              (HTTP)  Like  -L,  --location, but will allow sending the name +
              password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or
              may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to
              a site to which you will send your authentication info (which is
              plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

              Providing --location-trusted multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-location-trusted.

              Example:
               curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com

              See also -u, --user.

       -L, --location
              (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page  has  moved
              to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a
              3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the  request
              on  the  new  place.  If used together with -i, --include or -I,
              --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When au-
              thentication  is  used,  curl  only sends its credentials to the
              initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different  host,  it
              will  not be able to intercept the user+password. See also --lo-
              cation-trusted on how to change this. You can limit  the  amount
              of redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

              When  curl  follows  a redirect and if the request is a POST, it
              will send the following request with a GET if the HTTP  response
              was  301,  302,  or  303. If the response code was any other 3xx
              code, curl will re-send the following request using the same un-
              modified method.

              You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x
              response by using the dedicated  options  for  that:  --post301,
              --post302 and --post303.

              The  method  set  with  -X,  --request overrides the method curl
              would otherwise select to use.

              Providing -L, --location multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-location.

              Example:
               curl -L https://example.com

              See also --resolve and --alt-svc.

       --login-options <options>
              (IMAP  LDAP  POP3  SMTP) Specify the login options to use during
              server authentication.

              You can use login options to specify protocol  specific  options
              that  may  be  used during authentication. At present only IMAP,
              POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more information  about
              login  options  please  see  RFC  2384,  RFC 5092 and IETF draft
              draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt

              If --login-options is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com

              See also -u, --user. Added in 7.34.0.

       --mail-auth <address>
              (SMTP)  Specify  a  single address. This will be used to specify
              the authentication address (identity)  of  a  submitted  message
              that is being relayed to another server.

              If  --mail-auth  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from.

       --mail-from <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail  should  get
              sent from.

              If  --mail-from  is  provided  several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/

              See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth.

       --mail-rcpt-allowfails
              (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl
              will  abort  SMTP conversation if at least one of the recipients
              causes RCPT TO command to return an error.

              The default behavior can be changed by  passing  --mail-rcpt-al-
              lowfails  command-line option which will make curl ignore errors
              and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.

              If all recipients trigger RCPT TO  failures  and  this  flag  is
              specified,  curl  will still abort the SMTP conversation and re-
              turn the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.

              Providing --mail-rcpt-allowfails multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.

              Example:
               curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

              See also --mail-rcpt. Added in 7.69.0.

       --mail-rcpt <address>
              (SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or mailing list
              name. Repeat this option several times to send to  multiple  re-
              cipients.

              When  performing an address verification (VRFY command), the re-
              cipient should be specified as the user name or  user  name  and
              domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-
              ient should be specified using the mailing list  name,  such  as
              "Friends" or "London-Office".  (Added in 7.34.0)

              --mail-rcpt can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com

              See also --mail-rcpt-allowfails.

       -M, --manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

              Example:
               curl --manual

              See also -v, --verbose, --libcurl and --trace.

       --max-filesize <bytes>
              (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to
              download. If the file requested is larger than this  value,  the
              transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

              A  size  modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or 'K'
              will count  the  number  as  kilobytes,  'm'  or  'M'  makes  it
              megabytes,  while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K,
              3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)

              NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to  download,  and
              for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
              fer ends up being larger than this given limit.  If  --max-file-
              size is provided several times, the last set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --max-filesize 100K https://example.com

              See also --limit-rate.

       --max-redirs <num>
              (HTTP)  Set  maximum  number of redirections to follow. When -L,
              --location is used, to prevent  curl  from  following  too  many
              redirects,  by  default,  the  limit is set to 50 redirects. Set
              this option to -1 to make it unlimited.

              If --max-redirs is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --max-redirs 3 --location https://example.com

              See also -L, --location.

       -m, --max-time <fractional seconds>
              Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow each transfer to take.
              This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hanging  for
              hours  due  to slow networks or links going down.  Since 7.32.0,
              this option accepts decimal values, but the actual timeout  will
              decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases in deci-
              mal precision.

              If you enable retrying the transfer (--retry) then  the  maximum
              time counter is reset each time the transfer is retried. You can
              use --retry-max-time to limit the retry time.

              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.)  as  decimal
              separator  - not the local version even if it might be using an-
              other separator.

              If -m, --max-time is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --max-time 10 https://example.com
               curl --max-time 2.92 https://example.com

              See also --connect-timeout and --retry-max-time.

       --metalink
              This  option was previously used to specify a metalink resource.
              Metalink support has been disabled in curl since 7.78.0 for  se-
              curity reasons.

              If --metalink is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --metalink file https://example.com

              See also -Z, --parallel.

       --negotiate
              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

              This option requires a library built with GSS-API or  SSPI  sup-
              port.  Use  -V,  --version  to  see  if  your curl supports GSS-
              API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

              When using this option, you must also provide a fake -u,  --user
              option  to  activate the authentication code properly. Sending a
              '-u :' is enough as the user name  and  password  from  the  -u,
              --user option are not actually used.

              If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
              used.

              Providing --negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --negotiate -u : https://example.com

              See also --basic, --ntlm, --anyauth and --proxy-negotiate.

       --netrc-file <filename>
              This option is similar to -n, --netrc, except that  you  provide
              the  path  (absolute  or  relative)  to the netrc file that curl
              should use. You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.

              It will abide by --netrc-optional if specified.

              If --netrc-file is provided several times, the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --netrc-file netrc https://example.com

              See  also  -n, --netrc, -u, --user and -K, --config. This option
              is mutually exclusive to -n, --netrc.

       --netrc-optional
              Similar to -n, --netrc, but this option makes the  .netrc  usage
              optional and not mandatory as the -n, --netrc option does.

              Providing  --netrc-optional  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-netrc-optional.

              Example:
               curl --netrc-optional https://example.com

              See also --netrc-file. This option is mutually exclusive to  -n,
              --netrc.

       -n, --netrc
              Makes  curl  scan  the  .netrc  (_netrc  on Windows) file in the
              user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
              cally  used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable
              user authentication. See netrc(5) and ftp(1) for details on  the
              file  format.  Curl will not complain if that file does not have
              the right permissions (it should be neither  world-  nor  group-
              readable).  The  environment variable "HOME" is used to find the
              home directory.

              A quick and simple example of how to setup  a  .netrc  to  allow
              curl  to  FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user name 'my-
              self' and password 'secret' could look similar to:

               machine host.domain.com
               login myself
               password secret

              Providing -n, --netrc multiple times has no extra effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-netrc.

              Example:
               curl --netrc https://example.com

              See  also --netrc-file, -K, --config and -u, --user. This option
              is mutually exclusive to --netrc-file and --netrc-optional.

       -:, --next
              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
              associated  options.  This  allows  you  to send several URL re-
              quests, each with their own specific options, for example,  such
              as different user names or custom requests for each.

              -:,  --next  will  reset  all local options and only global ones
              will have their values survive over to the  operation  following
              the  -:,  --next  instruction. Global options include -v, --ver-
              bose, --trace, --trace-ascii and --fail-early.

              For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a  single  com-
              mand line:

               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

              -:, --next can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl https://example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
               curl -I https://example.com --next https://example.net/

              See also -Z, --parallel and -K, --config. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-alpn
              (HTTPS)  Disable  the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by de-
              fault if libcurl was built with an  SSL  library  that  supports
              ALPN.  ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negoti-
              ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.

              Providing --no-alpn multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --alpn.

              Example:
               curl --no-alpn https://example.com

              See  also  --no-npn and --http2. --no-alpn requires that the un-
              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       -N, --no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-
              uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
              will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
              necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
              will disable that buffering.

              Providing -N, --no-buffer multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --buffer.

              Example:
               curl --no-buffer https://example.com

              See also -#, --progress-bar.

       --no-clobber
              When  used  in  conjunction with the -o, --output, -J, --remote-
              header-name, -O, --remote-name,  or  --remote-name-all  options,
              curl avoids overwriting files that already exist. Instead, a dot
              and a number gets appended to the name of the file that would be
              created,  up  to filename.100 after which it will not create any
              file.

              Note that this is the negated option name documented.   You  can
              thus  use --clobber to enforce the clobbering, even if -J, --re-
              mote-header-name is specified.

              Providing --no-clobber multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --clobber.

              Example:
               curl --no-clobber --output local/dir/file https://example.com

              See also -o, --output and -O, --remote-name. Added in 7.83.0.

       --no-keepalive
              Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection.
              curl otherwise enables them by default.

              Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
              thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.

              Providing  --no-keepalive  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --keepalive.

              Example:
               curl --no-keepalive https://example.com

              See also --keepalive-time.

       --no-npn
              (HTTPS) In curl 7.86.0 and later, curl never uses NPN.

              Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN  is  enabled  by  default  if
              libcurl  was built with an SSL library that supports NPN. NPN is
              used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2  sup-
              port with the server during https sessions.

              Providing  --no-npn multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --npn.

              Example:
               curl --no-npn https://example.com

              See also --no-alpn and --http2. --no-npn requires that  the  un-
              derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

       --no-progress-meter
              Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or
              otherwise affecting warning and informational messages like  -s,
              --silent does.

              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
              thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter again.

              Providing --no-progress-meter multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --progress-meter.

              Example:
               curl --no-progress-meter -o store https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.

       --no-sessionid
              (TLS)  Disable  curl's use of SSL session-ID caching. By default
              all transfers are done using the cache. Note that while  nothing
              should  ever  get  hurt  by attempting to reuse SSL session-IDs,
              there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
              require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.

              Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
              thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

              Providing --no-sessionid multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --sessionid.

              Example:
               curl --no-sessionid https://example.com

              See also -k, --insecure.

       --noproxy <no-proxy-list>
              Comma-separated  list  of hosts for which not to use a proxy, if
              one is specified. The only wildcard is  a  single  *  character,
              which  matches  all  hosts,  and effectively disables the proxy.
              Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which  con-
              tains  the  hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, lo-
              cal.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and  www.local.com,
              but not www.notlocal.com.

              Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables
              that disable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY').  If  there's
              an  environment  variable disabling a proxy, you can set the no-
              proxy list to "" to override it.

              Since 7.86.0, IP addresses specified to this option can be  pro-
              vided  using  CIDR notation: an appended slash and number speci-
              fies the number of "network bits" out of the address to  use  in
              the comparison. For example "192.168.0.0/16" would match all ad-
              dresses starting with "192.168".

              If --noproxy is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --noproxy "www.example" https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy.

       --ntlm-wb
              (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style --ntlm does, but hand over
              the authentication to the separate binary  ntlmauth  application
              that is executed when needed.

              Providing --ntlm-wb multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --ntlm-wb -u user:password https://example.com

              See also --ntlm and --proxy-ntlm.

       --ntlm (HTTP)  Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM authentication
              method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
              It  is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever peo-
              ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
              behavior  should  not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone
              who uses NTLM to switch to a public and  documented  authentica-
              tion method instead, such as Digest.

              If  you  want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then
              use --proxy-ntlm.

              If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
              used.

              Providing --ntlm multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --ntlm -u user:password https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-ntlm.  --ntlm  requires  that  the underlying
              libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mutually exclu-
              sive to --basic and --negotiate and --digest and --anyauth.

       --oauth2-bearer <token>
              (IMAP  LDAP  POP3  SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer Token for OAUTH
              2.0 server authentication. The Bearer Token is used in  conjunc-
              tion  with  the  user name which can be specified as part of the
              --url or -u, --user options.

              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted  according  to  RFC
              6750.

              If --oauth2-bearer is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --oauth2-bearer "mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM" https://example.com

              See also --basic, --ntlm and --digest. Added in 7.33.0.

       --output-dir <dir>
              This option specifies the directory in  which  files  should  be
              stored, when -O, --remote-name or -o, --output are used.

              The  given  output directory is used for all URLs and output op-
              tions on the command line, up until the first -:, --next.

              If the specified target directory does not exist, the  operation
              will fail unless --create-dirs is also used.

              If  --output-dir  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --output-dir "tmp" -O https://example.com

              See also -O, --remote-name and -J,  --remote-header-name.  Added
              in 7.73.0.

       -o, --output <file>
              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
              [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the URL and you
              can  use  '#' followed by a number in the <file> specifier. That
              variable will be replaced with the current string  for  the  URL
              being fetched. Like in:

               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com" -o "#1_#2"

              You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
              have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the  same  command
              line, you can use it like this:

                curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

              and  the  order  of the -o options and the URLs does not matter,
              just that the first -o is for the first URL and so  on,  so  the
              above command line can also be written as

                curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

              See  also  the --create-dirs option to create the local directo-
              ries dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a  single  dash)
              will force the output to be done to stdout.

              To   suppress  response  bodies,  you  can  redirect  output  to
              /dev/null:

                curl example.com -o /dev/null

              Or for Windows use nul:

                curl example.com -o nul

              -o, --output can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -o file https://example.com
               curl "http://{one,two}.example.com" -o "file_#1.txt"
               curl "http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com" -o "#1_#2"
               curl -o file https://example.com -o file2 https://example.net

              See also -O, --remote-name, --remote-name-all and -J,  --remote-
              header-name.

       --parallel-immediate
              When  doing  parallel  transfers, this option will instruct curl
              that it should rather prefer opening up more connections in par-
              allel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be
              added as multiplexed streams on another connection.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing  --parallel-immediate  multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-parallel-immediate.

              Example:
               curl --parallel-immediate -Z https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

              See also -Z, --parallel and --parallel-max. Added in 7.68.0.

       --parallel-max <num>
              When asked to do parallel transfers, using -Z, --parallel,  this
              option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do simultane-
              ously.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              The default is 50.

              If  --parallel-max is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --parallel-max 100 -Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

              See also -Z, --parallel. Added in 7.66.0.

       -Z, --parallel
              Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to  the
              regular serial manner.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -Z, --parallel multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-parallel.

              Example:
               curl --parallel https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

              See also -:, --next and -v, --verbose. Added in 7.66.0.

       --pass <phrase>
              (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.

              If  --pass is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --pass secret --key file https://example.com

              See also --key and -u, --user.

       --path-as-is
              Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./  in  the  given
              URL  path.  Normally curl will squash or merge them according to
              standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

              Providing --path-as-is multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-path-as-is.

              Example:
               curl --path-as-is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd

              See also --request-target. Added in 7.42.0.

       --pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use  the  specified  public key file (or
              hashes) to verify the peer. This can be a path to a  file  which
              contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
              of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
              rated by ';'.

              When  negotiating  a  TLS  or SSL connection, the server sends a
              certificate indicating its identity. A public key  is  extracted
              from  this certificate and if it does not exactly match the pub-
              lic key provided to this option, curl will abort the  connection
              before sending or receiving any data.

              PEM/DER support:

              7.39.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit

              7.43.0: NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              sha256 support:

              7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL

              7.47.0: mbedtls

              Other SSL backends not supported.

              If  --pinnedpubkey is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl --pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

              See also --hostpubsha256. Added in 7.39.0.

       --post301
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
              non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
              may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post301 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post301.

              Example:
               curl --post301 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post302, --post303 and -L, --location.

       --post302
              (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST
              requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
              non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
              conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
              may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
              This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post302 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post302.

              Example:
               curl --post302 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post301, --post303 and -L, --location.

       --post303
              (HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST
              requests  into  GET  requests when following 303 redirections. A
              server may require a POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirect-
              ion. This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

              Providing --post303 multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-post303.

              Example:
               curl --post303 --location -d "data" https://example.com

              See also --post302, --post301 and -L, --location.

       --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to  an  HTTP  or
              HTTPS  -x,  --proxy.  In  such a case curl first connects to the
              SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS)  to  the  HTTP  or
              HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.

              The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-
              fix to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use  socks4://,
              socks4a://,  socks5://  or  socks5h://  to  request the specific
              SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified will  make  curl
              default to SOCKS4.

              If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
              assumed to be 1080.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
              URL  decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special charac-
              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              If --preproxy is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --socks5. Added in 7.52.0.

       -#, --progress-bar
              Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar in-
              stead of the standard, more informational, meter.

              This progress bar draws a single line of '#'  characters  across
              the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.
              For transfers without a known size, there  will  be  space  ship
              (-=o=-)  that  moves back and forth but only while data is being
              transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -#, --progress-bar multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-progress-bar.

              Example:
               curl -# -O https://example.com

              See also --styled-output.

       --proto-default <protocol>
              Tells curl to use protocol for any URL missing a scheme name.

              An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  CURLE_UNSUP-
              PORTED_PROTOCOL (1).

              This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

              Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the host
              name, see --url for details.

              If --proto-default is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proto-default https ftp.example.com

              See also --proto and --proto-redir. Added in 7.45.0.

       --proto-redir <protocols>
              Tells  curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect. Pro-
              tocols denied by --proto are not overridden by this option.  See
              --proto for how protocols are represented.

              Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

               curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com

              By default curl will only allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on re-
              direct (since 7.65.2). Specifying all or +all enables all proto-
              cols on redirects, which is not good for security.

              If  --proto-redir  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com

              See also --proto.

       --proto <protocols>
              Tells curl to limit what protocols it  may  use  for  transfers.
              Protocols  are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and
              are each a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed  by  zero
              or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:

              +  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-
                 ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

              -  Deny this protocol, removing it from the  list  of  protocols
                 already permitted.

              =  Permit  only this protocol (ignoring the list already permit-
                 ted), though subject to later modification by subsequent  en-
                 tries in the comma separated list.

              For example:

              --proto -ftps  uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

              --proto -all,https,+http
                             only enables http and https

              --proto =http,https
                             also only enables http and https

              Unknown  and  disabled  protocols produce a warning. This allows
              scripts to safely rely on being able to disable potentially dan-
              gerous protocols, without relying upon support for that protocol
              being built into curl to avoid an error.

              This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect
              is  the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of
              the option.

              If --proto is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

              See also --proto-redir and --proto-default.

       --proxy-anyauth
              Tells  curl to pick a suitable authentication method when commu-
              nicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might  cause  an  extra
              request/response round-trip.

              Providing --proxy-anyauth multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-basic and --proxy-digest.

       --proxy-basic
              Tells  curl  to use HTTP Basic authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a
              remote  host.  Basic  is  the default authentication method curl
              uses with proxies.

              Providing --proxy-basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-digest.

       --proxy-cacert <file>
              Same as --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-cacert is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-capath,  --cacert,  --capath and -x, --proxy.
              Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-capath <dir>
              Same as --capath but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-capath is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-capath /local/directory -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --proxy-cacert,  -x,  --proxy  and --capath. Added in
              7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert-type <type>
              Same as --cert-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-cert-type is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cert-type PEM --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-cert. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-cert <cert[:passwd]>
              Same as -E, --cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-cert  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-cert-type. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-ciphers <list>
              Same as --ciphers but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-ciphers is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --ciphers, --curves and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-crlfile <file>
              Same as --crlfile but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-crlfile is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-crlfile rejects.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --crlfile and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-digest
              Tells curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when  communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with
              a remote host.

              Providing --proxy-digest multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy-header <header/@file>
              (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP
              to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is
              the equivalent option to -H, --header but is for proxy  communi-
              cation  only  like  in CONNECT requests when you want a separate
              header sent to the proxy to what is sent to  the  actual  remote
              host.

              curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent
              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
              as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
              returns, they will only mess things up for you.

              Headers specified with this option will not be included  in  re-
              quests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.

              Starting  in  7.55.0, this option can take an argument in @file-
              name style, which then adds a header for each line in the  input
              file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.

              This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
              multiple headers.

              --proxy-header can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --proxy-header "X-First-Name: Joe" -x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl --proxy-header "User-Agent: surprise" -x http://proxy https://example.com
               curl --proxy-header "Host:" -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

       --proxy-insecure
              Same as -k, --insecure but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-insecure multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-proxy-insecure.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-insecure -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and -k, --insecure. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key-type <type>
              Same as --key-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-key-type  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-key-type DER --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-key and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-key <key>
              Same as --key but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-key is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-key-type and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-negotiate
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when
              communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for enabling
              HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

              Providing --proxy-negotiate multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-negotiate --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy-ntlm
              Tells  curl  to  use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating
              with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling NTLM with a remote
              host.

              Providing --proxy-ntlm multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ntlm --proxy-user user:passwd -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-negotiate and --proxy-anyauth.

       --proxy-pass <phrase>
              Same as --pass but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-pass  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-pass secret --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-key. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-pinnedpubkey <hashes>
              (TLS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  public  key  file  (or
              hashes)  to verify the proxy. This can be a path to a file which
              contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
              of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
              rated by ';'.

              When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection,  the  server  sends  a
              certificate  indicating  its identity. A public key is extracted
              from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the  pub-
              lic  key provided to this option, curl will abort the connection
              before sending or receiving any data.

              If --proxy-pinnedpubkey is provided several times, the last  set
              value will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
               curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

              See also --pinnedpubkey and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.59.0.

       --proxy-service-name <name>
              This  option allows you to change the service name for proxy ne-
              gotiation.

              If --proxy-service-name is provided several times, the last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-service-name "shrubbery" -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --service-name and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.43.0.

       --proxy-ssl-allow-beast
              Same as --ssl-allow-beast but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing  --proxy-ssl-allow-beast  multiple  times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-proxy-ssl-allow-beast.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ssl-allow-beast -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also --ssl-allow-beast and -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert
              Same as --ssl-auto-client-cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert multiple times has no ex-
              tra  effect.   Disable it again with --no-proxy-ssl-auto-client-
              cert.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See  also  --ssl-auto-client-cert  and  -x,  --proxy.  Added  in
              7.77.0.

       --proxy-tls13-ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS)  Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection to
              your HTTPS proxy when it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers
              suites  must  specify  valid  ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher
              suite details on this URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl  is  built  to  use
              OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
              you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the  --proxy-
              ciphers option.

              If --proxy-tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --tls13-ciphers and --curves. Added in 7.61.0.

       --proxy-tlsauthtype <type>
              Same as --tlsauthtype but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-tlsauthtype is provided several times, the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsauthtype SRP -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlsuser. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlspassword <string>
              Same as --tlspassword but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If  --proxy-tlspassword  is provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlspassword passwd -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlsuser. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsuser <name>
              Same as --tlsuser but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              If --proxy-tlsuser is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsuser smith -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy and --proxy-tlspassword. Added in 7.52.0.

       --proxy-tlsv1
              Same as -1, --tlsv1 but used in HTTPS proxy context.

              Providing --proxy-tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-tlsv1 -x https://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy. Added in 7.52.0.

       -U, --proxy-user <user:password>
              Specify  the user name and password to use for proxy authentica-
              tion.

              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either  Ne-
              gotiate  or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to select
              the user name and password from your environment by specifying a
              single colon with this option: "-U :".

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
              ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-
              dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same
              system as they  will  still  be  visible  for  a  moment  before
              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.

              If -U, --proxy-user is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy https://example.com

              See also --proxy-pass.

       -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
              Use the specified proxy.

              The  proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No
              protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
              socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a spe-
              cific SOCKS version to be used.

              Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set localhost
              for the host part. e.g. socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              HTTPS  proxy  support  via https:// protocol prefix was added in
              7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.

              Unrecognized and unsupported  proxy  protocols  cause  an  error
              since  7.52.0.   Prior  versions may ignore the protocol and use
              http:// instead.

              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,  it  is
              assumed to be 1080.

              This  option  overrides  existing environment variables that set
              the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable  setting  a
              proxy, you can set proxy to "" to override it.

              All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will trans-
              parently be converted to HTTP. It means  that  certain  protocol
              specific operations might not be available. This is not the case
              if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --prox-
              ytunnel option.

              User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
              URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special  charac-
              ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

              The  proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy envi-
              ronment variables, including the protocol prefix  (http://)  and
              the embedded user + password.

              When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with -P, --ftp-
              port, cannot be used.

              If -x, --proxy is provided several times,  the  last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com

              See also --socks5 and --proxy-basic.

       --proxy1.0 <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy  option  -x,
              --proxy,  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will
              specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

              Providing --proxy1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy, --socks5 and --preproxy.

       -p, --proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used -x, --proxy, this  option  will  make
              curl  tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with
              the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the  proxy  al-
              lows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tun-
              nel through to.

              To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is  set  to
              output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.

              Providing  -p, --proxytunnel multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-proxytunnel.

              Example:
               curl --proxytunnel -x http://proxy https://example.com

              See also -x, --proxy.

       --pubkey <key>
              (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-
              lic key in this separate file.

              (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public
              key from the private key file, so passing this option is  gener-
              ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
              libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8  or  higher
              that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)

              If  --pubkey  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/

              See also --pass.

       -Q, --quote <command>
              (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP  or  SFTP
              server.  Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place
              (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP  transfer,  to  be
              exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
              prefix them with a dash '-'.

              (FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has  changed  the
              working  directory,  just  before  the file transfer command(s),
              prefix the command with a '+'. This is not performed when a  di-
              rectory listing is performed.

              You may specify any number of commands.

              By  default  curl  will stop at first failure. To make curl con-
              tinue even if the command fails, prefix the command with an  as-
              terisk  (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of
              the commands, the entire operation will be aborted.

              You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959  de-
              fines  to  FTP  servers,  or one of the commands listed below to
              SFTP servers.

              This option can be used multiple times.

              SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets  SFTP
              quote  commands  itself  before sending them to the server. File
              names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special char-
              acters.  Following  is the list of all supported SFTP quote com-
              mands:

              atime date file
                     The atime command sets the last access time of  the  file
                     named  by  the file operand. The <date expression> can be
                     all sorts of date strings, see  the  curl_getdate(3)  man
                     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              chgrp group file
                     The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by
                     the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group
                     operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

              chmod mode file
                     The  chmod  command  modifies  the  file mode bits of the
                     specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                     number.

              chown user file
                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                     file operand to the user ID specified by the  user  oper-
                     and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

              ln source_file target_file
                     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                     target_file location pointing to  the  source_file  loca-
                     tion.

              mkdir directory_name
                     The  mkdir command creates the directory named by the di-
                     rectory_name operand.

              mtime date file
                     The mtime command sets the last modification time of  the
                     file named by the file operand. The <date expression> can
                     be all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man
                     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

              pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                     rent working directory.

              rename source target
                     The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                     the  source  operand to the destination path named by the
                     target operand.

              rm file
                     The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                     erand.

              rmdir directory
                     The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified
                     by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

              symlink source_file target_file
                     See ln.

       -Q, --quote can be used several times in a command line

       Example:
        curl --quote "DELE file" ftp://example.com/foo

       See also -X, --request.

       --random-file <file>
              Deprecated option. This option is ignored by curl since  7.84.0.
              Prior  to that it only had an effect on curl if built to use old
              versions of OpenSSL.

              Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered
              as  random  data. The data may be used to seed the random engine
              for SSL connections.

              If --random-file is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --random-file rubbish https://example.com

              See also --egd-file.

       -r, --range <range>
              (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial docu-
              ment) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP  server  or  a  local  FILE.
              Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

              0-499     specifies the first 500 bytes

              500-999   specifies the second 500 bytes

              -500      specifies the last 500 bytes

              9500-     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

              0-0,-1    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)

              100-199,500-599
                        specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)

              (*)  = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a mul-
              tipart response, which will be returned as-is by  curl!  Parsing
              or otherwise transforming this response is the responsibility of
              the caller.

              Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and  'stop'
              fields  of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit charac-
              ter is given in the range, the server's response will be unspec-
              ified, depending on the server's configuration.

              You  should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have
              this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to get  a  range,
              you will instead get the whole document.

              FTP  and  SFTP  range  downloads only support the simple 'start-
              stop' syntax (optionally with one of the numbers  omitted).  FTP
              use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

              If  -r,  --range  is  provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --range 22-44 https://example.com

              See also -C, --continue-at and -a, --append.

       --rate <max request rate>
              Specify the maximum transfer frequency you allow curl to  use  -
              in number of transfer starts per time unit (sometimes called re-
              quest rate). Without this  option,  curl  will  start  the  next
              transfer as fast as possible.

              If  given  several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the
              allowed rate, curl will wait until the next transfer is  started
              to  maintain  the requested rate. This option has no effect when
              -Z, --parallel is used.

              The request rate is provided as "N/U" where N is an integer num-
              ber  and U is a time unit. Supported units are 's' (second), 'm'
              (minute), 'h' (hour) and 'd' /(day, as in a 24 hour  unit).  The
              default  time  unit, if no "/U" is provided, is number of trans-
              fers per hour.

              If curl is told to allow 10 requests per  minute,  it  will  not
              start  the  next  request until 6 seconds have elapsed since the
              previous transfer was started.

              This function uses millisecond resolution. If the  allowed  fre-
              quency is set more than 1000 per second, it will instead run un-
              restricted.

              When retrying transfers,  enabled  with  --retry,  the  separate
              retry delay logic is used and not this setting.

              If  --rate is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Examples:
               curl --rate 2/s https://example.com
               curl --rate 3/h https://example.com
               curl --rate 14/m https://example.com

              See also --limit-rate and --retry-delay. Added in 7.84.0.

       --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of con-
              tent  or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed on un-
              altered, raw.

              Providing --raw multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable  it
              again with --no-raw.

              Example:
               curl --raw https://example.com

              See also --tr-encoding.

       -e, --referer <URL>
              (HTTP) Sends the "Referrer Page" information to the HTTP server.
              This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When
              used  with  -L,  --location  you  can  append ";auto" to the -e,
              --referer URL to make curl automatically set  the  previous  URL
              when  it  follows  a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be
              used alone, even if you do not set an initial -e, --referer.

              If -e, --referer is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl --referer "https://fake.example" https://example.com
               curl --referer "https://fake.example;auto" -L https://example.com
               curl --referer ";auto" -L https://example.com

              See also -A, --user-agent and -H, --header.

       -J, --remote-header-name
              (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the
              server-specified Content-Disposition  filename  instead  of  ex-
              tracting  a  filename  from the URL. If the server-provided file
              name contains a path, that will be stripped off before the  file
              name is used.

              The  file is saved in the current directory, or in the directory
              specified with --output-dir.

              If the server specifies a file name and a file  with  that  name
              already  exists  in  the  destination  directory, it will not be
              overwritten and an error will occur - unless you allow it by us-
              ing  the --clobber option. If the server does not specify a file
              name then this option has no effect.

              There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in  the  provided
              file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
              file names.

              This feature uses the name from the "filename"  field,  it  does
              not  yet  support the "filename*" field (filenames with explicit
              character sets).

              WARNING: Exercise judicious use of this  option,  especially  on
              Windows.  A  rogue  server  could  send you the name of a DLL or
              other file that could be loaded automatically by Windows or some
              third party software.

              Providing  -J,  --remote-header-name multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-header-name.

              Example:
               curl -OJ https://example.com/file

              See also -O, --remote-name.

       --remote-name-all
              This option changes the default action for all given URLs to  be
              dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each one. So if
              you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-
              all has been used, you must use "-o -" or --no-remote-name.

              Providing  --remote-name-all multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remote-name-all.

              Example:
               curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2

              See also -O, --remote-name.

       -O, --remote-name
              Write output to a local file named like the remote file we  get.
              (Only  the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
              off.)

              The file will be saved in the current working directory. If  you
              want  the  file  saved  in  a different directory, make sure you
              change the current working directory before invoking  curl  with
              this option or use --output-dir.

              The  remote  file  name  to use for saving is extracted from the
              given URL, nothing else, and if it already  exists  it  will  be
              overwritten.  If  you  want  the server to be able to choose the
              file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in
              addition  to  this option. If the server chooses a file name and
              that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or
              other  URL  encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as
              file name.

              You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs  you
              have.

              -O, --remote-name can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl -O https://example.com/filename

              See  also  --remote-name-all,  --output-dir  and  -J,  --remote-
              header-name.

       -R, --remote-time
              When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out  the  time-
              stamp  of the remote file, and if that is available make the lo-
              cal file get that same timestamp.

              Providing -R, --remote-time multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remote-time.

              Example:
               curl --remote-time -o foo https://example.com

              See also -O, --remote-name and -z, --time-cond.

       --remove-on-error
              When  curl  returns an error when told to save output in a local
              file, this option removes that saved file before  exiting.  This
              prevents  curl from leaving a partial file in the case of an er-
              ror during transfer.

              If the output is not a file, this option has no effect.

              Providing --remove-on-error multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-remove-on-error.

              Example:
               curl --remove-on-error -o output https://example.com

              See also -f, --fail. Added in 7.83.0.

       --request-target <path>
              (HTTP)  Tells curl to use an alternative "target" (path) instead
              of using the path as provided in the  URL.  Particularly  useful
              when  wanting  to  issue  HTTP requests without leading slash or
              other data that does not follow the regular  URL  pattern,  like
              "OPTIONS *".

              If  --request-target  is  provided  several  times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --request-target "*" -X OPTIONS https://example.com

              See also -X, --request. Added in 7.55.0.

       -X, --request <method>
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
              ing  with  the HTTP server. The specified request method will be
              used instead of the method otherwise  used  (which  defaults  to
              GET).  Read  the HTTP 1.1 specification for details and explana-
              tions. Common additional HTTP requests include PUT  and  DELETE,
              but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE
              and more.

              Normally you do not need this option. All sorts  of  GET,  HEAD,
              POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-
              mand line options.

              This option only changes the actual word used in  the  HTTP  re-
              quest, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if
              you want to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD  will  not
              suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.

              The  method  string  you set with -X, --request will be used for
              all requests, which if you for example use  -L,  --location  may
              cause  unintended side-effects when curl does not change request
              method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

              (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
              doing file lists with FTP.

              (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or
              RETR.

              (IMAP) Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead  of  LIST.
              (Added in 7.30.0)

              (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or
              VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

              If -X, --request is provided several times, the last  set  value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -X "DELETE" https://example.com
               curl -X NLST ftp://example.com/

              See also --request-target.

       --resolve <[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...>
              Provide  a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Us-
              ing this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified  ad-
              dress  and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to be
              used. Consider it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative  provided  on
              the  command line. The port number should be the number used for
              the specific protocol the host will be used for.  It  means  you
              need several entries if you want to provide address for the same
              host but different ports.

              By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any  host
              and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is re-
              solved last so any --resolve with a specific host and port  will
              be used first.

              The provided address set by this option will be used even if -4,
              --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6 is set to make curl use another IP version.

              By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry time out
              after  curl's  default  timeout  (1 minute). Note that this will
              only make sense for long running parallel transfers with  a  lot
              of files. In such cases, if this option is used curl will try to
              resolve the host as it normally would once the timeout  has  ex-
              pired.

              Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added
              in 7.57.0.

              Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was  added
              in 7.59.0.

              Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.

              Support for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.

              This option can be used many times to add many host names to re-
              solve.

              --resolve can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com

              See also --connect-to and --alt-svc.

       --retry-all-errors
              Retry on any error. This option is used together with --retry.

              This option is the "sledgehammer" of retrying. Do not  use  this
              option by default (eg in curlrc), there may be unintended conse-
              quences such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not  use
              with  redirected  input or output. You'd be much better off han-
              dling your unique problems in shell script. Please read the  ex-
              ample below.

              WARNING:  For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed
              flaky transfers as close as possible to how they  were  started,
              but  this  is  not possible with redirected input or output. For
              example, before retrying it removes output data  from  a  failed
              partial  transfer  that  was  written to an output file. However
              this is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or > file, which
              are  not  reset.  We strongly suggest you do not parse or record
              output via redirect in combination with this option,  since  you
              may receive duplicate data.

              By default curl will not error on an HTTP response code that in-
              dicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was successful. For exam-
              ple,  if  a  server replies 404 Not Found and the reply is fully
              received then that is not an error. When --retry  is  used  then
              curl  will retry on some HTTP response codes that indicate tran-
              sient HTTP errors, but that does not include most  4xx  response
              codes  such  as  404. If you want to retry on all response codes
              that indicate HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) then  combine  with  -f,
              --fail.

              Providing --retry-all-errors multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-retry-all-errors.

              Example:
               curl --retry 5 --retry-all-errors https://example.com

              See also --retry. Added in 7.71.0.

       --retry-connrefused
              In addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as  a
              transient  error  too  for --retry. This option is used together
              with --retry.

              Providing --retry-connrefused multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-retry-connrefused.

              Example:
               curl --retry-connrefused --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry and --retry-all-errors. Added in 7.52.0.

       --retry-delay <seconds>
              Make  curl  sleep  this  amount of time before each retry when a
              transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes  the  de-
              fault  backoff  time  algorithm between retries). This option is
              only interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay  to
              zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

              If  --retry-delay  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --retry-delay 5 --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry.

       --retry-max-time <seconds>
              The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt.  Re-
              tries  will  be done as usual (see --retry) as long as the timer
              has not reached this given limit. Notice that if the  timer  has
              not  reached  the limit, the request will be made and while per-
              forming, it may take longer than  this  given  time  period.  To
              limit  a  single request's maximum time, use -m, --max-time. Set
              this option to zero to not timeout retries.

              If --retry-max-time is provided  several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --retry-max-time 30 --retry 10 https://example.com

              See also --retry.

       --retry <num>
              If  a  transient  error is returned when curl tries to perform a
              transfer, it will retry this number of times before  giving  up.
              Setting  the  number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the
              default). Transient error means either: a timeout,  an  FTP  4xx
              response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response
              code.

              When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first  wait  one
              second  and  then for all forthcoming retries it will double the
              waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be  the
              delay  between  the  rest of the retries. By using --retry-delay
              you  disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See   also
              --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.

              Since  curl  7.66.0,  curl will comply with the Retry-After: re-
              sponse header if one was present to know when to issue the  next
              retry.

              If --retry is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --retry 7 https://example.com

              See also --retry-max-time.

       --sasl-authzid <identity>
              Use this authorization identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN au-
              thentication,  in addition to the authentication identity (auth-
              cid) as specified by -u, --user.

              If the option is not specified, the server will derive  the  au-
              thzid  from  the authcid, but if specified, and depending on the
              server implementation, it may be used to access  another  user's
              inbox,  that  the  user  has been granted access to, or a shared
              mailbox for example.

              If --sasl-authzid is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --sasl-authzid zid imap://example.com/

              See also --login-options. Added in 7.66.0.

       --sasl-ir
              Enable initial response in SASL authentication.

              Providing --sasl-ir multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable
              it again with --no-sasl-ir.

              Example:
               curl --sasl-ir imap://example.com/

              See also --sasl-authzid. Added in 7.31.0.

       --service-name <name>
              This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

              Examples:   --negotiate   --service-name   sockd    would    use
              sockd/server-name.

              If  --service-name is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --service-name sockd/server https://example.com

              See also --negotiate and --proxy-service-name. Added in 7.43.0.

       -S, --show-error
              When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message
              if it fails.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing -S, --show-error multiple times has no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-show-error.

              Example:
               curl --show-error --silent https://example.com

              See also --no-progress-meter.

       -s, --silent
              Silent  or  quiet mode. Do not show progress meter or error mes-
              sages. Makes Curl mute. It will still output the  data  you  ask
              for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect
              it.

              Use -S, --show-error in  addition  to  this  option  to  disable
              progress meter but still show error messages.

              Providing -s, --silent multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-silent.

              Example:
               curl -s https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose, --stderr and --no-progress-meter.

       --socks4 <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
              fied,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. Using this socket type make
              curl resolve the host name and passing the  address  on  to  the
              proxy.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix domain socket, use localhost for
              host, e.g.  socks4://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This  option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4 proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks4:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If  --socks4  is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks4 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks4a, --socks5 and --socks5-hostname.

       --socks4a <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
              ified,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. This asks the proxy to re-
              solve the host name.

              To specify proxy on a unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for
              host, e.g.  socks4a://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4a proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks4a:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If --socks4a is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks4a hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks4, --socks5 and --socks5-hostname.

       --socks5-basic
              Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connect-
              ing to a SOCKS5 proxy.  The username/password authentication  is
              enabled  by  default.   Use --socks5-gssapi to force GSS-API au-
              thentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing --socks5-basic multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-basic --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5-gssapi-nec
              As part of the GSS-API negotiation a protection mode is  negoti-
              ated.  RFC  1961 says in section 4.3/4.4 it should be protected,
              but the  NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.  The  option
              --socks5-gssapi-nec  allows the unprotected exchange of the pro-
              tection mode negotiation.

              Providing --socks5-gssapi-nec multiple times has  no  extra  ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-socks5-gssapi-nec.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi-nec --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5.

       --socks5-gssapi-service <name>
              The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
              This option allows you to change it.

              Examples:  --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service   sockd
              would  use sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name --socks5-gssapi-
              service sockd/real-name  would  use  sockd/real-name  for  cases
              where the proxy-name does not match the principal name.

              If  --socks5-gssapi-service  is provided several times, the last
              set value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi-service sockd --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5.

       --socks5-gssapi
              Tells curl to use GSS-API authentication when  connecting  to  a
              SOCKS5  proxy.  The GSS-API authentication is enabled by default
              (if curl is compiled with GSS-API support).  Use  --socks5-basic
              to force username/password authentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

              Providing  --socks5-gssapi  multiple  times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-socks5-gssapi.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-gssapi --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

              See also --socks5. Added in 7.55.0.

       --socks5-hostname <host[:port]>
              Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the  proxy  resolve  the
              host  name).  If the port number is not specified, it is assumed
              at port 1080.

              To specify proxy on a unix  domain  socket,  use  localhost  for
              host, e.g.  socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5  host-
              name proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5h:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              If --socks5-hostname is provided several  times,  the  last  set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5-hostname proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

              See also --socks5 and --socks4a.

       --socks5 <host[:port]>
              Use  the  specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host name lo-
              cally. If the port number is not specified,  it  is  assumed  at
              port 1080.

              To  specify  proxy  on  a  unix domain socket, use localhost for
              host, e.g.  socks5://localhost/path/to/socket.sock

              This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
              are mutually exclusive.

              This  option is superfluous since you can specify a socks5 proxy
              with -x, --proxy using a socks5:// protocol prefix.

              Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
              the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
              such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
              nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

              This  option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS
              or LDAP.

              If --socks5 is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --socks5 proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

              See also --socks5-hostname and --socks4a.

       -Y, --speed-limit <speed>
              If a transfer is slower than this given speed (in bytes per sec-
              ond) for speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time  is  set
              with -y, --speed-time and is 30 if not set.

              If  -Y,  --speed-limit  is  provided several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

              See also -y, --speed-time, --limit-rate and -m, --max-time.

       -y, --speed-time <seconds>
              If a transfer runs slower than speed-limit bytes per second dur-
              ing  a speed-time period, the transfer is aborted. If speed-time
              is used, the default speed-limit will be 1 unless set  with  -Y,
              --speed-limit.

              This option controls transfers (in both directions) but will not
              affect slow connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try  the
              --connect-timeout option.

              If  -y,  --speed-time  is  provided  several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

              See also -Y, --speed-limit and --limit-rate.

       --ssl-allow-beast
              This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
              SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option is not
              used, the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause  interop-
              erability problems with some older SSL implementations.

              WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this
              flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing --ssl-allow-beast multiple times has no extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ssl-allow-beast.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-allow-beast https://example.com

              See also --proxy-ssl-allow-beast and -k, --insecure.

       --ssl-auto-client-cert
              Tell  libcurl  to automatically locate and use a client certifi-
              cate for authentication, when requested by the server. This  op-
              tion  is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL li-
              brary). Prior to 7.77.0 this was the default behavior in libcurl
              with Schannel. Since the server can request any certificate that
              supports client authentication in the OS  certificate  store  it
              could be a privacy violation and unexpected.

              Providing --ssl-auto-client-cert multiple times has no extra ef-
              fect.  Disable it again with --no-ssl-auto-client-cert.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-auto-client-cert https://example.com

              See also --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert. Added in 7.77.0.

       --ssl-no-revoke
              (Schannel) This option tells curl to disable certificate revoca-
              tion checks.  WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and
              by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

              Providing --ssl-no-revoke multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-ssl-no-revoke.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-no-revoke https://example.com

              See also --crlfile. Added in 7.44.0.

       --ssl-reqd
              (FTP  IMAP  POP3  SMTP LDAP) Require SSL/TLS for the connection.
              Terminates the connection if the transfer cannot be upgraded  to
              use SSL/TLS.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully
              supported by the OpenLDAP backend and rejected  by  the  generic
              ldap backend if explicit TLS is required.

              This  option  is unnecessary if you use a URL scheme that in it-
              self implies immediate and implicit use of TLS, like  for  FTPS,
              IMAPS,  POP3S,  SMTPS and LDAPS. Such transfers will always fail
              if the TLS handshake does not work.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl-reqd.

              Providing --ssl-reqd multiple times has no extra  effect.   Dis-
              able it again with --no-ssl-reqd.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-reqd ftp://example.com

              See also --ssl and -k, --insecure.

       --ssl-revoke-best-effort
              (Schannel)  This option tells curl to ignore certificate revoca-
              tion checks when they failed due to missing/offline distribution
              points for the revocation check lists.

              Providing  --ssl-revoke-best-effort  multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ssl-revoke-best-effort.

              Example:
               curl --ssl-revoke-best-effort https://example.com

              See also --crlfile and -k, --insecure. Added in 7.70.0.

       --ssl  (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP LDAP) Warning: this is considered  an  inse-
              cure  option.  Consider using --ssl-reqd instead to be sure curl
              upgrades to a secure connection.

              Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection. Reverts to  a  non-secure
              connection  if  the  server  does  not support SSL/TLS. See also
              --ftp-ssl-control and --ssl-reqd for different levels of encryp-
              tion required.

              This option is handled in LDAP since version 7.81.0. It is fully
              supported by the OpenLDAP backend and  ignored  by  the  generic
              ldap backend.

              Please  note that a server may close the connection if the nego-
              tiation does not succeed.

              This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl.  That  option  name
              can still be used but will be removed in a future version.

              Providing  --ssl multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it
              again with --no-ssl.

              Example:
               curl --ssl pop3://example.com/

              See also --ssl-reqd, -k, --insecure and --ciphers.

       -2, --sslv2
              (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv2, but start-
              ing  in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv2 is widely
              considered insecure (see RFC 6176).

              Providing -2, --sslv2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --sslv2 https://example.com

              See also --http1.1 and --http2. -2, --sslv2  requires  that  the
              underlying  libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is mu-
              tually exclusive to -3, --sslv3 and -1,  --tlsv1  and  --tlsv1.1
              and --tlsv1.2.

       -3, --sslv3
              (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv3, but start-
              ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv3 is  widely
              considered insecure (see RFC 7568).

              Providing -3, --sslv3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --sslv3 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -3, --sslv3 requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is  mu-
              tually  exclusive  to  -2, --sslv2 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1
              and --tlsv1.2.

       --stderr <file>
              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead.  If
              the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --stderr is provided several times, the last set  value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --stderr output.txt https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent.

       --styled-output
              Enables  the automatic use of bold font styles when writing HTTP
              headers to the terminal. Use --no-styled-output to  switch  them
              off.

              Styled output requires a terminal that supports bold fonts. This
              feature is not present on curl for Windows due to lack  of  this
              capability.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing --styled-output multiple times has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-styled-output.

              Example:
               curl --styled-output -I https://example.com

              See also -I, --head and -v, --verbose. Added in 7.61.0.

       --suppress-connect-headers
              When  -p, --proxytunnel is used and a CONNECT request is made do
              not output proxy CONNECT response headers. This option is  meant
              to  be  used  with  -D, --dump-header or -i, --include which are
              used to show protocol headers in the output. It has no effect on
              debug  options  such as -v, --verbose or --trace, or any statis-
              tics.

              Providing --suppress-connect-headers multiple times has no extra
              effect.  Disable it again with --no-suppress-connect-headers.

              Example:
               curl --suppress-connect-headers --include -x proxy https://example.com

              See also -D, --dump-header, -i, --include and -p, --proxytunnel.
              Added in 7.54.0.

       --tcp-fastopen
              Enable use of TCP Fast Open (RFC7413).

              Providing --tcp-fastopen multiple times  has  no  extra  effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tcp-fastopen.

              Example:
               curl --tcp-fastopen https://example.com

              See also --false-start. Added in 7.49.0.

       --tcp-nodelay
              Turn  on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3) man
              page for details about this option.

              Since 7.50.2, curl sets this option by default and you  need  to
              explicitly switch it off if you do not want it on.

              Providing  --tcp-nodelay  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tcp-nodelay.

              Example:
               curl --tcp-nodelay https://example.com

              See also -N, --no-buffer.

       -t, --telnet-option <opt=val>
              Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

              TTYPE=<term> Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=<X display> Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=<var,val> Sets an environment variable.

              -t, --telnet-option can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl -t TTYPE=vt100 telnet://example.com/

              See also -K, --config.

       --tftp-blksize <value>
              (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be >512). This is the block
              size that curl will try to use when transferring data to or from
              a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

              If --tftp-blksize is provided several times, the last set  value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tftp-blksize 1024 tftp://example.com/file

              See also --tftp-no-options.

       --tftp-no-options
              (TFTP) Tells curl not to send TFTP options requests.

              This  option  improves  interop with some legacy servers that do
              not acknowledge or properly implement TFTP  options.  When  this
              option is used --tftp-blksize is ignored.

              Providing  --tftp-no-options multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tftp-no-options.

              Example:
               curl --tftp-no-options tftp://192.168.0.1/

              See also --tftp-blksize. Added in 7.48.0.

       -z, --time-cond <time>
              (HTTP FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than  the
              given  time  and date, or one that has been modified before that
              time. The <date expression> can be all sorts of date strings  or
              if  it  does not match any internal ones, it is taken as a file-
              name and tries to get the modification date (mtime) from  <file>
              instead.  See  the curl_getdate(3) man pages for date expression
              details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
              a  document that is older than the given date/time, default is a
              document that is newer than the specified date/time.

              If -z, --time-cond is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Examples:
               curl -z "Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl -z "-Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00" https://example.com
               curl -z file https://example.com

              See also --etag-compare and -R, --remote-time.

       --tls-max <VERSION>
              (SSL) VERSION defines maximum supported TLS version. The minimum
              acceptable version  is  set  by  tlsv1.0,  tlsv1.1,  tlsv1.2  or
              tlsv1.3.

              If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
              fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

              default
                     Use up to recommended TLS version.

              1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.

              1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.

              1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.

              1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

       If --tls-max is provided several times, the  last  set  value  will  be
       used.

       Examples:
        curl --tls-max 1.2 https://example.com
        curl --tls-max 1.3 --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

       See  also  --tlsv1.0, --tlsv1.1, --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3. --tls-max re-
       quires that the underlying libcurl was built to support TLS.  Added  in
       7.54.0.

       --tls13-ciphers <ciphersuite list>
              (TLS)  Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection if
              it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers suites  must  specify
              valid  ciphers.  Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher suite details on this
              URL:

               https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

              This option is currently used only when curl  is  built  to  use
              OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
              you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --ciphers
              option.

              If --tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 https://example.com

              See also --ciphers and --curves. Added in 7.61.0.

       --tlsauthtype <type>
              Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only  supported  op-
              tion  is  "SRP",  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If  --tlsuser  and
              --tlspassword are specified but --tlsauthtype is not, then  this
              option defaults to "SRP". This option works only if the underly-
              ing libcurl  is  built  with  TLS-SRP  support,  which  requires
              OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS-SRP support.

              If  --tlsauthtype  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlsauthtype SRP https://example.com

              See also --tlsuser.

       --tlspassword <string>
              Set password for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
              fied with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlsuser also be set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If  --tlspassword  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also --tlsuser.

       --tlsuser <name>
              Set username for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
              fied  with  --tlsauthtype.  Requires  that --tlspassword also is
              set.

              This option does not work with TLS 1.3.

              If --tlsuser is provided several times, the last set value  will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

              See also --tlspassword.

       --tlsv1.0
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this  option  was  documented  to  allow
              _only_ TLS 1.0.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.0 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.1
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this  option  was  documented  to  allow
              _only_ TLS 1.1.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.1 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3 and --tls-max. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.2
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              In old versions of curl this  option  was  documented  to  allow
              _only_ TLS 1.2.  That behavior was inconsistent depending on the
              TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
              sion.

              Providing --tlsv1.2 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.3 and --tls-max. Added in 7.34.0.

       --tlsv1.3
              (TLS)  Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 or later when connect-
              ing to a remote TLS server.

              If the connection is done without TLS, this option  has  no  ef-
              fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

              Note that TLS 1.3 is not supported by all TLS backends.

              Providing --tlsv1.3 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1.3 https://example.com

              See also --tlsv1.2 and --tls-max. Added in 7.52.0.

       -1, --tlsv1
              (SSL)  Tells curl to use at least TLS version 1.x when negotiat-
              ing with a remote TLS server. That  means  TLS  version  1.0  or
              higher

              Providing -1, --tlsv1 multiple times has no extra effect.

              Example:
               curl --tlsv1 https://example.com

              See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -1, --tlsv1 requires that the
              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This option is  mu-
              tually exclusive to --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.

       --tr-encoding
              (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one
              of the algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the  data  while
              receiving it.

              Providing  --tr-encoding  multiple  times  has  no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-tr-encoding.

              Example:
               curl --tr-encoding https://example.com

              See also --compressed.

       --trace-ascii <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
              cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

              This is similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and only
              shows  the  ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output that
              might be easier to read for untrained humans.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If  --trace-ascii  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --trace-ascii log.txt https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and --trace. This option is mutually  ex-
              clusive to --trace and -v, --verbose.

       --trace-time
              Prepends  a  time  stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl
              displays.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Providing --trace-time multiple times has no extra effect.  Dis-
              able it again with --no-trace-time.

              Example:
               curl --trace-time --trace-ascii output https://example.com

              See also --trace and -v, --verbose.

       --trace <file>
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
              cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use
              "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.  Use  "%"  as
              filename to have the output sent to stderr.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              If --trace is provided several times, the last set value will be
              used.

              Example:
               curl --trace log.txt https://example.com

              See also --trace-ascii and --trace-time. This option is mutually
              exclusive to -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

       --unix-socket <path>
              (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using
              the network.

              If  --unix-socket  is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl --unix-socket socket-path https://example.com

              See also --abstract-unix-socket. Added in 7.40.0.

       -T, --upload-file <file>
              This transfers the specified local file to the  remote  URL.  If
              there is no file part in the specified URL, curl will append the
              local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
              directory  to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or
              curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
              name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
              fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will
              be used.

              Use  the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a
              given file.  Alternately, the file name "."  (a  single  period)
              may  be  specified  instead  of "-" to use stdin in non-blocking
              mode to allow reading server output while  stdin  is  being  up-
              loaded.

              You  can  specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on the com-
              mand line. Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies  what  to
              upload  and  to  where. curl also supports "globbing" of the -T,
              --upload-file argument, meaning that  you  can  upload  multiple
              files  to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style sup-
              ported in the URL.

              When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data  is  assumed
              to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of
              headers and mail body formatted correctly by the  user  as  curl
              will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.

              -T, --upload-file can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl -T file https://example.com
               curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.example.com/
               curl --upload-file "{file1,file2}" https://example.com

              See also -G, --get and -I, --head.

       --url-query <data>
              (all)  This  option adds a piece of data, usually a name + value
              pair, to the end of the URL query part. The syntax is  identical
              to that used for --data-urlencode with one extension:

              If the argument starts with a '+' (plus), the rest of the string
              is provided as-is unencoded.

              The query part of a URL is the one following the  question  mark
              on the right end.

              --url-query can be used several times in a command line

              Examples:
               curl --url-query name=val https://example.com
               curl --url-query =encodethis http://example.net/foo
               curl --url-query name@file https://example.com
               curl --url-query @fileonly https://example.com
               curl --url-query "+name=%20foo" https://example.com

              See also --data-urlencode and -G, --get. Added in 7.87.0.

       --url <url>
              Specify  a  URL  to  fetch. This option is mostly handy when you
              want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

              If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as "http://"  or
              "ftp://"  etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host. If
              the outermost sub-domain name matches  DICT,  FTP,  IMAP,  LDAP,
              POP3  or  SMTP  then  that protocol will be used, otherwise HTTP
              will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
              default protocol, see --proto-default for details.

              To  control  where  this URL is written, use the -o, --output or
              the -O, --remote-name options.

              WARNING: On Windows, particular file://  accesses  can  be  con-
              verted to network accesses by the operating system. Beware!

              --url can be used several times in a command line

              Example:
               curl --url https://example.com

              See also -:, --next and -K, --config.

       -B, --use-ascii
              (FTP  LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be en-
              forced by using a URL that  ends  with  ";type=A".  This  option
              causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

              Providing  -B,  --use-ascii  multiple times has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-use-ascii.

              Example:
               curl -B ftp://example.com/README

              See also --crlf and --data-ascii.

       -A, --user-agent <name>
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
              To  encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
              quote marks. This header can also be set with the  -H,  --header
              or the --proxy-header options.

              If  you give an empty argument to -A, --user-agent (""), it will
              remove the header completely from the request. If you  prefer  a
              blank header, you can set it to a single space (" ").

              If  -A,  --user-agent  is  provided  several times, the last set
              value will be used.

              Example:
               curl -A "Agent 007" https://example.com

              See also -H, --header and --proxy-header.

       -u, --user <user:password>
              Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-
              tion. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.

              If  you  simply  specify  the  user name, curl will prompt for a
              password.

              The user name and passwords are split up  on  the  first  colon,
              which  makes  it impossible to use a colon in the user name with
              this option. The password can, still.

              On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
              ment  from  process listings. This is not enough to protect cre-
              dentials from possibly getting seen by other users on  the  same
              system  as  they  will  still  be  visible  for  a moment before
              cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
              stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.

              When  using  Kerberos  V5 with a Windows based server you should
              include the Windows domain name in the user name, in  order  for
              the  server  to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you do
              not, then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

              When using NTLM, the user name can be specified  simply  as  the
              user  name,  without the domain, if there is a single domain and
              forest in your setup for example.

              To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon  Name  or
              UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
              user@example.com respectively.

              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and  perform  Ker-
              beros  V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you can
              tell curl to select the user name and password from  your  envi-
              ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: "-u :".

              If -u, --user is provided several times, the last set value will
              be used.

              Example:
               curl -u user:secret https://example.com

              See also -n, --netrc and -K, --config.

       -v, --verbose
              Makes curl verbose during the operation.  Useful  for  debugging
              and  seeing  what's  going  on "under the hood". A line starting
              with '>' means "header data" sent by  curl,  '<'  means  "header
              data"  received  by  curl  that is hidden in normal cases, and a
              line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might
              be the option you are looking for.

              If you think this option still does not give you enough details,
              consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
              use of -:, --next.

              Use -s, --silent to make curl really quiet.

              Providing  -v,  --verbose  multiple  times  has no extra effect.
              Disable it again with --no-verbose.

              Example:
               curl --verbose https://example.com

              See also -i, --include. This option  is  mutually  exclusive  to
              --trace and --trace-ascii.

       -V, --version
              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

              The  first  line  includes the full version of curl, libcurl and
              other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

              The second line (starts with "Protocols:") shows  all  protocols
              that libcurl reports to support.

              The third line (starts with "Features:") shows specific features
              libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

              alt-svc
                     Support for the Alt-Svc: header is provided.

              AsynchDNS
                     This curl uses asynchronous name  resolves.  Asynchronous
                     name  resolves can be done using either the c-ares or the
                     threaded resolver backends.

              brotli Support for automatic brotli compression over HTTP(S).

              CharConv

                     (like EBCDIC)

              Debug  This  curl  uses a libcurl built with Debug. This enables
                     more error-tracking and memory debugging etc.  For  curl-
                     developers only!

              gsasl  The  built-in  SASL authentication includes extensions to
                     support SCRAM because libcurl was built with libgsasl.

              GSS-API
                     GSS-API is supported.

              HSTS   HSTS support is present.

              Largefile
                     This curl supports transfers of large files, files larger
                     than 2GB.

              libz   Automatic decompression (via gzip, deflate) of compressed
                     files over HTTP is supported.

              MultiSSL
                     This curl supports multiple TLS backends.

              NTLM   NTLM authentication is supported.

              NTLM_WB
                     NTLM delegation to winbind helper is supported.

              PSL    PSL is short for Public Suffix List and means  that  this
                     curl  has  been  built  with knowledge about "public suf-
                     fixes".

              SPNEGO SPNEGO authentication is supported.

              SSL    SSL versions of various protocols are supported, such  as

       Example:
        curl --version

       See also -h, --help and -M, --manual.

       -w, --write-out <format>
              Make curl display information on stdout after a completed trans-
              fer. The format is a string that may contain  plain  text  mixed
              with  any  number of variables. The format can be specified as a
              literal "string", or you can have curl read the  format  from  a
              file  with  "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format from
              stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will  be  substituted
              by  the  value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below.
              All variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output  a
              normal  % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline by
              using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

              The output will be written to standard output, but this  can  be
              switched to standard error by using %{stderr}.

              Output  HTTP  headers  from  the  most  recent  request by using
              %header{name} where name is the case  insensitive  name  of  the
              header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are ex-
              actly as sent over the network, with leading and trailing white-
              space trimmed. Added in curl 7.84.0.

              NOTE: In Windows the %-symbol is a special symbol used to expand
              environment variables. In batch files all occurrences of %  must
              be  doubled  when  using this option to properly escape. If this
              option is used at the command prompt then the %  cannot  be  es-
              caped and unintended expansion is possible.

              The variables available are:

              certs          Output  the  certificate chain with details. Sup-
                             ported only by  the  OpenSSL,  GnuTLS,  Schannel,
                             NSS,  GSKit  and Secure Transport backends (Added
                             in 7.88.0)

              content_type   The Content-Type of the  requested  document,  if
                             there was any.

              errormsg       The error message. (Added in 7.75.0)

              exitcode       The numerical exitcode of the transfer. (Added in
                             7.75.0)

              filename_effective
                             The ultimate filename that curl  writes  out  to.
                             This  is only meaningful if curl is told to write
                             to a file  with  the  -O,  --remote-name  or  -o,
                             --output  option. It's most useful in combination
                             with the -J, --remote-header-name option.

              ftp_entry_path The initial path curl ended up in when logging on
                             to the remote FTP server.

              header_json    A JSON object with all HTTP response headers from
                             the recent transfer. Values are provided  as  ar-
                             rays, since in the case of multiple headers there
                             can be multiple values. (Added in 7.83.0)

                             The header names provided in lowercase, listed in
                             order of appearance over the wire. Except for du-
                             plicated headers. They are grouped on  the  first
                             occurrence  of  that  header,  each value is pre-
                             sented in the JSON array.

              http_code      The numerical response code that was found in the
                             last retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer.

              http_connect   The numerical code that was found in the last re-

                             cently done connection - can be  either  IPv4  or
                             IPv6.

              local_port     The  local  port number of the most recently done
                             connection.

              method         The http method used in the most recent HTTP  re-
                             quest. (Added in 7.72.0)

              num_certs      Number of server certificates received in the TLS
                             handshake. Supported only by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS,

                             request (restarted at each redirect).  Note  that
                             the  status  line  IS  NOT  a  header.  (Added in
                             7.73.0)

              num_redirects  Number of redirects that were followed in the re-

              onerror        The  rest  of  the  output  is  only shown if the
                             transfer returned  a  non-zero  error  (Added  in
                             7.75.0)

              proxy_ssl_verify_result
                             The result of the HTTPS proxy's SSL peer certifi-
                             cate verification that was requested. 0 means the
                             verification was successful. (Added in 7.52.0)

              redirect_url   When an HTTP request was made without -L, --loca-
                             tion to follow redirects (or when --max-redirs is
                             met),  this  variable  will show the actual URL a
                             redirect would have gone to.

              referer        The Referer: header, if there was any. (Added  in
                             7.76.0)

              remote_ip      The  remote  IP address of the most recently done

                             was effectively used. (Added in 7.52.0)

              size_download  The  total  amount of bytes that were downloaded.
                             This is the size of the body/data that was trans-
                             ferred, excluding headers.

              size_header    The total amount of bytes of the downloaded head-
                             ers.

              size_request   The total amount of bytes that were sent  in  the

              speed_download The average download speed that curl measured for
                             the complete download. Bytes per second.

              speed_upload   The average upload speed that curl  measured  for
                             the complete upload. Bytes per second.

              ssl_verify_result

                             tion that was requested. 0 means the verification
                             was successful.

              stderr         From  this  point  on, the -w, --write-out output
                             will be written  to  standard  error.  (Added  in
                             7.63.0)

              stdout         From  this  point  on, the -w, --write-out output
                             will be written to standard output.  This is  the
                             default,  but  can  be  used to switch back after
                             switching to stderr.  (Added in 7.63.0)

              time_appconnect
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til  the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the re-
                             mote host was completed.

              time_connect   The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy)
                             was completed.

              time_namelookup
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til the name resolving was completed.

              time_pretransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the file transfer was just  about  to  begin.
                             This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                             tiations that are specific to the particular pro-
                             tocol(s) involved.

              time_redirect  The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
                             steps including name lookup, connect, pretransfer
                             and  transfer  before  the  final transaction was
                             started. time_redirect shows the complete  execu-
                             tion time for multiple redirections.

              time_starttransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the first byte was just about  to  be  trans-
                             ferred.  This  includes time_pretransfer and also
                             the time the server needed to calculate  the  re-
                             sult.

              time_total     The  total time, in seconds, that the full opera-
                             tion lasted.

              url            The URL that was fetched. (Added in 7.75.0)

              urlnum         The URL index number of this transfer, 0-indexed.
                             De-globbed  URLs  share  the same index number as
                             the origin globbed URL. (Added in 7.75.0)

              url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most mean-
                             ingful  if you have told curl to follow location:
                             headers.

              If -w, --write-out is provided several times, the last set value
              will be used.

              Example:
               curl -w '%{http_code}\n' https://example.com

              See also -v, --verbose and -I, --head.

       --xattr
              When  saving  output  to a file, this option tells curl to store
              certain file metadata in extended  file  attributes.  Currently,
              the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP,
              the content type is stored in the mime_type  attribute.  If  the
              file  system  does not support extended attributes, a warning is
              issued.

              Providing --xattr multiple times has no extra  effect.   Disable
              it again with --no-xattr.

              Example:
               curl --xattr -o storage https://example.com

              See also -R, --remote-time, -w, --write-out and -v, --verbose.

COMMAND: wget

DESCRIPTION: Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.

USAGE: wget [option]... [URL]...

OPTIONS:
Option Syntax
       Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
       option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more
       convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix
       different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
       arguments.  Thus you may write:

               wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log

       The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
       be omitted.  Instead of -o log you can write -olog.

       You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
       like:

               wget -drc <URL>

       This is completely equivalent to:

               wget -d -r -c <URL>

       Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
       terminate them with --.  So the following will try to download URL -x,
       reporting failure to log:

               wget -o log -- -x

       The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
       convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
       useful to clear the .wgetrc settings.  For instance, if your .wgetrc
       sets "exclude_directories" to /cgi-bin, the following example will
       first reset it, and then set it to exclude /~nobody and /~somebody.
       You can also clear the lists in .wgetrc.

               wget -X "" -X /~nobody,/~somebody

       Most options that do not accept arguments are boolean options, so named
       because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no ("boolean")
       variable.  For example, --follow-ftp tells Wget to follow FTP links
       from HTML files and, on the other hand, --no-glob tells it not to
       perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A boolean option is either
       affirmative or negative (beginning with --no).  All such options share
       several properties.

       Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is the
       opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the documented
       existence of --follow-ftp assumes that the default is to not follow FTP
       links from HTML pages.

       Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the --no- to the
       option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the --no-
       prefix.  This might seem superfluous---if the default for an
       affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way to
       explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change the
       default.  For instance, using "follow_ftp = on" in .wgetrc makes Wget
       follow FTP links by default, and using --no-follow-ftp is the only way
       to restore the factory default from the command line.

   Basic Startup Options
       -V
       --version
           Display the version of Wget.

       -h
       --help
           Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.

       -b
       --background
           Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
           specified via the -o, output is redirected to wget-log.

       -e command
       --execute command
           Execute command as if it were a part of .wgetrc.  A command thus
           invoked will be executed after the commands in .wgetrc, thus taking
           precedence over them.  If you need to specify more than one wgetrc
           command, use multiple instances of -e.

   Logging and Input File Options
       -o logfile
       --output-file=logfile
           Log all messages to logfile.  The messages are normally reported to
           standard error.

       -a logfile
       --append-output=logfile
           Append to logfile.  This is the same as -o, only it appends to
           logfile instead of overwriting the old log file.  If logfile does
           not exist, a new file is created.

       -d
       --debug
           Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
           developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
           administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
           support, in which case -d will not work.  Please note that
           compiling with debug support is always safe---Wget compiled with
           the debug support will not print any debug info unless requested
           with -d.

       -q
       --quiet
           Turn off Wget's output.

       -v
       --verbose
           Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
           output is verbose.

       -nv
       --no-verbose
           Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use -q for that),
           which means that error messages and basic information still get
           printed.

       --report-speed=type
           Output bandwidth as type.  The only accepted value is bits.

       -i file
       --input-file=file
           Read URLs from a local or external file.  If - is specified as
           file, URLs are read from the standard input.  (Use ./- to read from
           a file literally named -.)

           If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command
           line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input
           file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to be
           retrieved.  If --force-html is not specified, then file should
           consist of a series of URLs, one per line.

           However, if you specify --force-html, the document will be regarded
           as html.  In that case you may have problems with relative links,
           which you can solve either by adding "<base href="url">" to the
           documents or by specifying --base=url on the command line.

           If the file is an external one, the document will be automatically
           treated as html if the Content-Type matches text/html.
           Furthermore, the file's location will be implicitly used as base
           href if none was specified.

       --input-metalink=file
           Downloads files covered in local Metalink file. Metalink version 3
           and 4 are supported.

       --keep-badhash
           Keeps downloaded Metalink's files with a bad hash. It appends
           .badhash to the name of Metalink's files which have a checksum
           mismatch, except without overwriting existing files.

       --metalink-over-http
           Issues HTTP HEAD request instead of GET and extracts Metalink
           metadata from response headers. Then it switches to Metalink
           download.  If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls back to
           ordinary HTTP download.  Enables Content-Type:
           application/metalink4+xml files download/processing.

       --metalink-index=number
           Set the Metalink application/metalink4+xml metaurl ordinal NUMBER.
           From 1 to the total number of "application/metalink4+xml"
           available.  Specify 0 or inf to choose the first good one.
           Metaurls, such as those from a --metalink-over-http, may have been
           sorted by priority key's value; keep this in mind to choose the
           right NUMBER.

       --preferred-location
           Set preferred location for Metalink resources. This has effect if
           multiple resources with same priority are available.

       --xattr
           Enable use of file system's extended attributes to save the
           original URL and the Referer HTTP header value if used.

           Be aware that the URL might contain private information like access
           tokens or credentials.

       -F
       --force-html
           When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
           file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
           HTML files on your local disk, by adding "<base href="url">" to
           HTML, or using the --base command-line option.

       -B URL
       --base=URL
           Resolves relative links using URL as the point of reference, when
           reading links from an HTML file specified via the -i/--input-file
           option (together with --force-html, or when the input file was
           fetched remotely from a server describing it as HTML). This is
           equivalent to the presence of a "BASE" tag in the HTML input file,
           with URL as the value for the "href" attribute.

           For instance, if you specify http://foo/bar/a.html for URL, and
           Wget reads ../baz/b.html from the input file, it would be resolved
           to http://foo/baz/b.html.

       --config=FILE
           Specify the location of a startup file you wish to use instead of
           the default one(s). Use --no-config to disable reading of config
           files.  If both --config and --no-config are given, --no-config is
           ignored.

       --rejected-log=logfile
           Logs all URL rejections to logfile as comma separated values.  The
           values include the reason of rejection, the URL and the parent URL
           it was found in.

   Download Options
       --bind-address=ADDRESS
           When making client TCP/IP connections, bind to ADDRESS on the local
           machine.  ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or IP address.
           This option can be useful if your machine is bound to multiple IPs.

       --bind-dns-address=ADDRESS
           [libcares only] This address overrides the route for DNS requests.
           If you ever need to circumvent the standard settings from
           /etc/resolv.conf, this option together with --dns-servers is your
           friend.  ADDRESS must be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 address.
           Wget needs to be built with libcares for this option to be
           available.

       --dns-servers=ADDRESSES
           [libcares only] The given address(es) override the standard
           nameserver addresses,  e.g. as configured in /etc/resolv.conf.
           ADDRESSES may be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, comma-
           separated.  Wget needs to be built with libcares for this option to
           be available.

       -t number
       --tries=number
           Set number of tries to number. Specify 0 or inf for infinite
           retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception of
           fatal errors like "connection refused" or "not found" (404), which
           are not retried.

       -O file
       --output-document=file
           The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
           will be concatenated together and written to file.  If - is used as
           file, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link
           conversion.  (Use ./- to print to a file literally named -.)

           Use of -O is not intended to mean simply "use the name file instead
           of the one in the URL;" rather, it is analogous to shell
           redirection: wget -O file http://foo is intended to work like wget
           -O - http://foo > file; file will be truncated immediately, and all
           downloaded content will be written there.

           For this reason, -N (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in
           combination with -O: since file is always newly created, it will
           always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this
           combination is used.

           Similarly, using -r or -p with -O may not work as you expect: Wget
           won't just download the first file to file and then download the
           rest to their normal names: all downloaded content will be placed
           in file. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been reinstated
           (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where this
           behavior can actually have some use.

           A combination with -nc is only accepted if the given output file
           does not exist.

           Note that a combination with -k is only permitted when downloading
           a single document, as in that case it will just convert all
           relative URIs to external ones; -k makes no sense for multiple URIs
           when they're all being downloaded to a single file; -k can be used
           only when the output is a regular file.

       -nc
       --no-clobber
           If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
           Wget's behavior depends on a few options, including -nc.  In
           certain cases, the local file will be clobbered, or overwritten,
           upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.

           When running Wget without -N, -nc, -r, or -p, downloading the same
           file in the same directory will result in the original copy of file
           being preserved and the second copy being named file.1.  If that
           file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named file.2,
           and so on.  (This is also the behavior with -nd, even if -r or -p
           are in effect.)  When -nc is specified, this behavior is
           suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of file.
           Therefore, ""no-clobber"" is actually a misnomer in this
           mode---it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric
           suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the
           multiple version saving that's prevented.

           When running Wget with -r or -p, but without -N, -nd, or -nc, re-
           downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting
           the old.  Adding -nc will prevent this behavior, instead causing
           the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the
           server to be ignored.

           When running Wget with -N, with or without -r or -p, the decision
           as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on
           the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.  -nc may not
           be specified at the same time as -N.

           A combination with -O/--output-document is only accepted if the
           given output file does not exist.

           Note that when -nc is specified, files with the suffixes .html or
           .htm will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they had
           been retrieved from the Web.

       --backups=backups
           Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by adding a
           .1 suffix (_1 on VMS) to the file name.  Such backup files are
           rotated to .2, .3, and so on, up to backups (and lost beyond that).

       --no-netrc
           Do not try to obtain credentials from .netrc file. By default
           .netrc file is searched for credentials in case none have been
           passed on command line and authentication is required.

       -c
       --continue
           Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
           you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
           Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

                   wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

           If there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory, Wget
           will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
           will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal
           to the length of the local file.

           Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want
           the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
           the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default
           behavior.  -c only affects resumption of downloads started prior to
           this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting
           around.

           Without -c, the previous example would just download the remote
           file to ls-lR.Z.1, leaving the truncated ls-lR.Z file alone.

           If you use -c on a non-empty file, and the server does not support
           continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from scratch
           and overwrite the existing file entirely.

           Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use -c on a file which is of equal
           size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
           file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the
           file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it
           was changed on the server since your last download
           attempt)---because "continuing" is not meaningful, no download
           occurs.

           On the other side of the coin, while using -c, any file that's
           bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
           download and only "(length(remote) - length(local))" bytes will be
           downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
           behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can
           use wget -c to download just the new portion that's been appended
           to a data collection or log file.

           However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
           changed, as opposed to just appended to, you'll end up with a
           garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
           really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
           especially careful of this when using -c in conjunction with -r,
           since every file will be considered as an "incomplete download"
           candidate.

           Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
           -c is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a "transfer
           interrupted" string into the local file.  In the future a
           "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.

           Note that -c only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers that
           support the "Range" header.

       --start-pos=OFFSET
           Start downloading at zero-based position OFFSET.  Offset may be
           expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the `k' suffix, or megabytes
           with the `m' suffix, etc.

           --start-pos has higher precedence over --continue.  When
           --start-pos and --continue are both specified, wget will emit a
           warning then proceed as if --continue was absent.

           Server support for continued download is required, otherwise
           --start-pos cannot help.  See -c for details.

       --progress=type
           Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
           indicators are "dot" and "bar".

           The "bar" indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII progress
           bar graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display) indicating the status of
           retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the "dot" bar will be used
           by default.

           Use --progress=dot to switch to the "dot" display.  It traces the
           retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
           fixed amount of downloaded data.

           The progress type can also take one or more parameters.  The
           parameters vary based on the type selected.  Parameters to type are
           passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon (:) like
           this: --progress=type:parameter1:parameter2.

           When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the style by
           specifying the type as dot:style.  Different styles assign
           different meaning to one dot.  With the "default" style each dot
           represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a
           line.  The "binary" style has a more "computer"-like
           orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which
           makes for 384K lines).  The "mega" style is suitable for
           downloading large files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there
           are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line
           contains 3M).  If "mega" is not enough then you can use the "giga"
           style---each dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a
           cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains 32M).

           With --progress=bar, there are currently two possible parameters,
           force and noscroll.

           When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls back to
           "dot", even if --progress=bar was passed to Wget during invocation.
           This behaviour can be overridden and the "bar" output forced by
           using the "force" parameter as --progress=bar:force.

           By default, the bar style progress bar scroll the name of the file
           from left to right for the file being downloaded if the filename
           exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.  In certain
           cases, such as with --progress=bar:force, one may not want the
           scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By passing the "noscroll"
           parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the filename as
           possible without scrolling through it.

           Note that you can set the default style using the "progress"
           command in .wgetrc.  That setting may be overridden from the
           command line.  For example, to force the bar output without
           scrolling, use --progress=bar:force:noscroll.

       --show-progress
           Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.

           By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose mode.
           One may however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen in
           conjunction with any other verbosity modes like --no-verbose or
           --quiet.  This is often a desired a property when invoking wget to
           download several small/large files.  In such a case, wget could
           simply be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output
           on the screen.

           This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
           stderr when used alongside the --output-file option.

       -N
       --timestamping
           Turn on time-stamping.

       --no-if-modified-since
           Do not send If-Modified-Since header in -N mode. Send preliminary
           HEAD request instead. This has only effect in -N mode.

       --no-use-server-timestamps
           Don't set the local file's timestamp by the one on the server.

           By default, when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set to
           match those from the remote file. This allows the use of
           --timestamping on subsequent invocations of wget. However, it is
           sometimes useful to base the local file's timestamp on when it was
           actually downloaded; for that purpose, the
           --no-use-server-timestamps option has been provided.

       -S
       --server-response
           Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
           servers.

       --spider
           When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web spider,
           which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
           they are there.  For example, you can use Wget to check your
           bookmarks:

                   wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

           This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
           functionality of real web spiders.

       -T seconds
       --timeout=seconds
           Set the network timeout to seconds seconds.  This is equivalent to
           specifying --dns-timeout, --connect-timeout, and --read-timeout,
           all at the same time.

           When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
           abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies
           like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled
           by default is a 900-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0
           disables it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is
           best not to change the default timeout settings.

           All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
           subsecond values.  For example, 0.1 seconds is a legal (though
           unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for
           checking server response times or for testing network latency.

       --dns-timeout=seconds
           Set the DNS lookup timeout to seconds seconds.  DNS lookups that
           don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By default,
           there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that implemented by
           system libraries.

       --connect-timeout=seconds
           Set the connect timeout to seconds seconds.  TCP connections that
           take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default, there is no
           connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.

       --read-timeout=seconds
           Set the read (and write) timeout to seconds seconds.  The "time" of
           this timeout refers to idle time: if, at any point in the download,
           no data is received for more than the specified number of seconds,
           reading fails and the download is restarted.  This option does not
           directly affect the duration of the entire download.

           Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection
           sooner than this option requires.  The default read timeout is 900
           seconds.

       --limit-rate=amount
           Limit the download speed to amount bytes per second.  Amount may be
           expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the k suffix, or megabytes with
           the m suffix.  For example, --limit-rate=20k will limit the
           retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
           reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available
           bandwidth.

           This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in
           conjunction with power suffixes; for example, --limit-rate=2.5k is
           a legal value.

           Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
           amount of time after a network read that took less time than
           specified by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the TCP
           transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate.
           However, it may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so
           don't be surprised if limiting the rate doesn't work well with very
           small files.

       -w seconds
       --wait=seconds
           Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
           of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
           making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time
           can be specified in minutes using the "m" suffix, in hours using
           "h" suffix, or in days using "d" suffix.

           Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
           or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
           to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
           retry.  The waiting interval specified by this function is
           influenced by "--random-wait", which see.

       --waitretry=seconds
           If you don't want Wget to wait between every retrieval, but only
           between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.  Wget
           will use linear backoff, waiting 1 second after the first failure
           on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on
           that file, up to the maximum number of seconds you specify.

           By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.

       --random-wait
           Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval
           programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant
           similarities in the time between requests. This option causes the
           time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * wait seconds,
           where wait was specified using the --wait option, in order to mask
           Wget's presence from such analysis.

           A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
           consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the
           fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to
           ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing
           DHCP-supplied addresses.

           The --random-wait option was inspired by this ill-advised
           recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to
           the actions of one.

       --no-proxy
           Don't use proxies, even if the appropriate *_proxy environment
           variable is defined.

       -Q quota
       --quota=quota
           Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
           specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with k suffix), or
           megabytes (with m suffix).

           Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if
           you specify wget -Q10k https://example.com/ls-lR.gz, all of the
           ls-lR.gz will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several URLs
           are specified on the command-line.  The quota is checked only at
           the end of each downloaded file, so it will never result in a
           partially downloaded file. Thus you may safely type wget -Q2m -i
           sites---download will be aborted after the file that exhausts the
           quota is completely downloaded.

           Setting quota to 0 or to inf unlimits the download quota.

       --no-dns-cache
           Turn off caching of DNS lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the IP
           addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to repeatedly
           contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set of hosts
           it retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget
           run will contact DNS again.

           However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
           desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a short-
           running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues a new
           DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to "gethostbyname" or
           "getaddrinfo") each time it makes a new connection.  Please note
           that this option will not affect caching that might be performed by
           the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such as
           NSCD.

           If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you probably
           won't need it.

       --restrict-file-names=modes
           Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during
           generation of local filenames.  Characters that are restricted by
           this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with %HH, where HH is the
           hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character.
           This option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be
           either lower- or uppercase.

           By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe
           as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control
           characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful
           for changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to
           a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of
           the control characters, or you want to further restrict characters
           to only those in the ASCII range of values.

           The modes are a comma-separated set of text values. The acceptable
           values are unix, windows, nocontrol, ascii, lowercase, and
           uppercase. The values unix and windows are mutually exclusive (one
           will override the other), as are lowercase and uppercase. Those
           last are special cases, as they do not change the set of characters
           that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to be
           converted either to lower- or uppercase.

           When "unix" is specified, Wget escapes the character / and the
           control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  This is the
           default on Unix-like operating systems.

           When "windows" is given, Wget escapes the characters \, |, /, :, ?,
           ", *, <, >, and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and
           128--159.  In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses + instead
           of : to separate host and port in local file names, and uses @
           instead of ? to separate the query portion of the file name from
           the rest.  Therefore, a URL that would be saved as
           www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah in Unix mode would be
           saved as www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah in Windows mode.
           This mode is the default on Windows.

           If you specify nocontrol, then the escaping of the control
           characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when
           you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8 characters, on a
           system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8 (some possible
           byte values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the range of
           values designated by Wget as "controls").

           The ascii mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are
           outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127)
           shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose
           encoding does not match the one used locally.

       -4
       --inet4-only
       -6
       --inet6-only
           Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With --inet4-only or
           -4, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA records in
           DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in URLs.
           Conversely, with --inet6-only or -6, Wget will only connect to IPv6
           hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.

           Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an
           IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the host's
           DNS record.  If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
           Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it can connect
           to.  (Also see "--prefer-family" option described below.)

           These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or
           IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid
           debugging or to deal with broken network configuration.  Only one
           of --inet6-only and --inet4-only may be specified at the same time.
           Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.

       --prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6
           When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
           with specified address family first.  The address order returned by
           DNS is used without change by default.

           This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing
           hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4
           networks.  For example, www.kame.net resolves to
           2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085 and to 203.178.141.194.  When
           the preferred family is "IPv4", the IPv4 address is used first;
           when the preferred family is "IPv6", the IPv6 address is used
           first; if the specified value is "none", the address order returned
           by DNS is used without change.

           Unlike -4 and -6, this option doesn't inhibit access to any address
           family, it only changes the order in which the addresses are
           accessed.  Also note that the reordering performed by this option
           is stable---it doesn't affect order of addresses of the same
           family.  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of
           all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.

       --retry-connrefused
           Consider "connection refused" a transient error and try again.
           Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect to the
           site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server
           is not running at all and that retries would not help.  This option
           is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear
           for short periods of time.

       --user=user
       --password=password
           Specify the username user and password password for both FTP and
           HTTP file retrieval.  These parameters can be overridden using the
           --ftp-user and --ftp-password options for FTP connections and the
           --http-user and --http-password options for HTTP connections.

       --ask-password
           Prompt for a password for each connection established. Cannot be
           specified when --password is being used, because they are mutually
           exclusive.

       --use-askpass=command
           Prompt for a user and password using the specified command.  If no
           command is specified then the command in the environment variable
           WGET_ASKPASS is used.  If WGET_ASKPASS is not set then the command
           in the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS is used.

           You can set the default command for use-askpass in the .wgetrc.
           That setting may be overridden from the command line.

       --no-iri
           Turn off internationalized URI (IRI) support. Use --iri to turn it
           on. IRI support is activated by default.

           You can set the default state of IRI support using the "iri"
           command in .wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command
           line.

       --local-encoding=encoding
           Force Wget to use encoding as the default system encoding. That
           affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments from locale
           to UTF-8 for IRI support.

           Wget use the function "nl_langinfo()" and then the "CHARSET"
           environment variable to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII is used.

           You can set the default local encoding using the "local_encoding"
           command in .wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command
           line.

       --remote-encoding=encoding
           Force Wget to use encoding as the default remote server encoding.
           That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files from remote
           encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch. This options is only
           useful for IRI support, for the interpretation of non-ASCII
           characters.

           For HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP "Content-Type"
           header and in HTML "Content-Type http-equiv" meta tag.

           You can set the default encoding using the "remoteencoding" command
           in .wgetrc. That setting may be overridden from the command line.

       --unlink
           Force Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing file. This
           option is useful for downloading to the directory with hardlinks.

   Directory Options
       -nd
       --no-directories
           Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
           recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get saved
           to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
           more than once, the filenames will get extensions .n).

       -x
       --force-directories
           The opposite of -nd---create a hierarchy of directories, even if
           one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. wget -x
           http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt will save the downloaded file to
           fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt.

       -nH
       --no-host-directories
           Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
           invoking Wget with -r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ will create a
           structure of directories beginning with fly.srk.fer.hr/.  This
           option disables such behavior.

       --protocol-directories
           Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names.
           For example, with this option, wget -r http://host will save to
           http/host/... rather than just to host/....

       --cut-dirs=number
           Ignore number directory components.  This is useful for getting a
           fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
           will be saved.

           Take, for example, the directory at
           ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/.  If you retrieve it with -r, it
           will be saved locally under ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/.  While the
           -nH option can remove the ftp.xemacs.org/ part, you are still stuck
           with pub/xemacs.  This is where --cut-dirs comes in handy; it makes
           Wget not "see" number remote directory components.  Here are
           several examples of how --cut-dirs option works.

                   No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
                   -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .

                   --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
                   ...

           If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option
           is similar to a combination of -nd and -P.  However, unlike -nd,
           --cut-dirs does not lose with subdirectories---for instance, with
           -nH --cut-dirs=1, a beta/ subdirectory will be placed to
           xemacs/beta, as one would expect.

       -P prefix
       --directory-prefix=prefix
           Set directory prefix to prefix.  The directory prefix is the
           directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
           to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is . (the
           current directory).

   HTTP Options
       --default-page=name
           Use name as the default file name when it isn't known (i.e., for
           URLs that end in a slash), instead of index.html.

       -E
       --adjust-extension
           If a file of type application/xhtml+xml or text/html is downloaded
           and the URL does not end with the regexp \.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?, this
           option will cause the suffix .html to be appended to the local
           filename.  This is useful, for instance, when you're mirroring a
           remote site that uses .asp pages, but you want the mirrored pages
           to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another good use for
           this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A URL
           like http://site.com/article.cgi?25 will be saved as
           article.cgi?25.html.

           Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every
           time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local
           X.html file corresponds to remote URL X (since it doesn't yet know
           that the URL produces output of type text/html or
           application/xhtml+xml.

           As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files
           of type text/css end in the suffix .css, and the option was renamed
           from --html-extension, to better reflect its new behavior. The old
           option name is still acceptable, but should now be considered
           deprecated.

           As of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded
           files with a "Content-Encoding" of br, compress, deflate or gzip
           end in the suffix .br, .Z, .zlib and .gz respectively.

           At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded to
           include suffixes for other types of content, including content
           types that are not parsed by Wget.

       --http-user=user
       --http-password=password
           Specify the username user and password password on an HTTP server.
           According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them using
           either the "basic" (insecure), the "digest", or the Windows "NTLM"
           authentication scheme.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself.
           Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run
           "ps".  To prevent the passwords from being seen, use the
           --use-askpass or store them in .wgetrc or .netrc, and make sure to
           protect those files from other users with "chmod".  If the
           passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in those
           files either---edit the files and delete them after Wget has
           started the download.

       --no-http-keep-alive
           Turn off the "keep-alive" feature for HTTP downloads.  Normally,
           Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you
           download more than one document from the same server, they get
           transferred over the same TCP connection.  This saves time and at
           the same time reduces the load on the server.

           This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-
           alive) connections don't work for you, for example due to a server
           bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the
           connections.

       --no-cache
           Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the remote
           server appropriate directives (Cache-Control: no-cache and Pragma:
           no-cache) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
           returning the cached version. This is especially useful for
           retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

           Caching is allowed by default.

       --no-cookies
           Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for
           maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a
           cookie using the "Set-Cookie" header, and the client responds with
           the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the
           server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange
           this information, some consider them a breach of privacy.  The
           default is to use cookies; however, storing cookies is not on by
           default.

       --load-cookies file
           Load cookies from file before the first HTTP retrieval.  file is a
           textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
           cookies.txt file.

           You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
           require that you be logged in to access some or all of their
           content.  The login process typically works by the web server
           issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
           credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when
           accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

           Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
           browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved
           by --load-cookies---simply point Wget to the location of the
           cookies.txt file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
           would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
           cookie files in different locations:

           "Netscape 4.x."
               The cookies are in ~/.netscape/cookies.txt.

           "Mozilla and Netscape 6.x."
               Mozilla's cookie file is also named cookies.txt, located
               somewhere under ~/.mozilla, in the directory of your profile.
               The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
               ~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt.

           "Internet Explorer."
               You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File
               menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been tested
               with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with
               earlier versions.

           "Other browsers."
               If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
               --load-cookies will only work if you can locate or produce a
               cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.

           If you cannot use --load-cookies, there might still be an
           alternative.  If your browser supports a "cookie manager", you can
           use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're
           mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the cookie, and
           manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
           "official" cookie support:

                   wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: <name>=<value>"

       --save-cookies file
           Save cookies to file before exiting.  This will not save cookies
           that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called "session
           cookies"), but also see --keep-session-cookies.

       --keep-session-cookies
           When specified, causes --save-cookies to also save session cookies.
           Session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be
           kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser.  Saving
           them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit the
           home page before you can access some pages.  With this option,
           multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far
           as the site is concerned.

           Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session
           cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget's
           --load-cookies recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
           confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
           treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want
           --save-cookies to preserve them again, you must use
           --keep-session-cookies again.

       --ignore-length
           Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more precise)
           send out bogus "Content-Length" headers, which makes Wget go wild,
           as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot this
           syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
           each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has
           closed on the very same byte.

           With this option, Wget will ignore the "Content-Length" header---as
           if it never existed.

       --header=header-line
           Send header-line along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP
           request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it must
           contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain
           newlines.

           You may define more than one additional header by specifying
           --header more than once.

                   wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
                        --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                          http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

           Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
           previous user-defined headers.

           As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers
           otherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to
           connect to localhost, but to specify foo.bar in the "Host" header:

                   wget --header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/

           In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of --header caused
           sending of duplicate headers.

       --compression=type
           Choose the type of compression to be used.  Legal values are auto,
           gzip and none.

           If auto or gzip are specified, Wget asks the server to compress the
           file using the gzip compression format. If the server compresses
           the file and responds with the "Content-Encoding" header field set
           appropriately, the file will be decompressed automatically.

           If none is specified, wget will not ask the server to compress the
           file and will not decompress any server responses. This is the
           default.

           Compression support is currently experimental. In case it is turned
           on, please report any bugs to "bug-wget@gnu.org".

       --max-redirect=number
           Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a
           resource.  The default is 20, which is usually far more than
           necessary. However, on those occasions where you want to allow more
           (or fewer), this is the option to use.

       --proxy-user=user
       --proxy-password=password
           Specify the username user and password password for authentication
           on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the "basic"
           authentication scheme.

           Security considerations similar to those with --http-password
           pertain here as well.

       --referer=url
           Include `Referer: url' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
           retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they
           are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only
           come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
           point to them.

       --save-headers
           Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
           actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.

       -U agent-string
       --user-agent=agent-string
           Identify as agent-string to the HTTP server.

           The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
           "User-Agent" header field.  This enables distinguishing the WWW
           software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
           protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as Wget/version,
           version being the current version number of Wget.

           However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
           tailoring the output according to the "User-Agent"-supplied
           information.  While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has
           been abused by servers denying information to clients other than
           (historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet
           Explorer.  This option allows you to change the "User-Agent" line
           issued by Wget.  Use of this option is discouraged, unless you
           really know what you are doing.

           Specifying empty user agent with --user-agent="" instructs Wget not
           to send the "User-Agent" header in HTTP requests.

       --post-data=string
       --post-file=file
           Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified
           data in the request body.  --post-data sends string as data,
           whereas --post-file sends the contents of file.  Other than that,
           they work in exactly the same way. In particular, they both expect
           content of the form "key1=value1&key2=value2", with percent-
           encoding for special characters; the only difference is that one
           expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other
           accepts its content from a file. In particular, --post-file is not
           for transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as
           "key=value" data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like
           everything else. Wget does not currently support
           "multipart/form-data" for transmitting POST data; only
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". Only one of --post-data and
           --post-file should be specified.

           Please note that wget does not require the content to be of the
           form "key1=value1&key2=value2", and neither does it test for it.
           Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to it. Most
           servers however expect the POST data to be in the above format when
           processing HTML Forms.

           When sending a POST request using the --post-file option, Wget
           treats the file as a binary file and will send every character in
           the POST request without stripping trailing newline or formfeed
           characters. Any other control characters in the text will also be
           sent as-is in the POST request.

           Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data
           in advance.  Therefore the argument to "--post-file" must be a
           regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like /dev/stdin won't
           work.  It's not quite clear how to work around this limitation
           inherent in HTTP/1.0.  Although HTTP/1.1 introduces chunked
           transfer that doesn't require knowing the request length in
           advance, a client can't use chunked unless it knows it's talking to
           an HTTP/1.1 server.  And it can't know that until it receives a
           response, which in turn requires the request to have been completed
           -- a chicken-and-egg problem.

           Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST
           request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the response
           code returned by the server.  In case of a 301 Moved Permanently,
           302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in
           accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a POST request.  In case
           a server wants the client to change the Request method upon
           redirection, it should send a 303 See Other response code.

           This example shows how to log in to a server using POST and then
           proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible
           to authorized users:

                   # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
                   wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
                        --post-data 'user=foo&password=bar' \
                        http://example.com/auth.php

                   # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
                   wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
                        -p http://example.com/interesting/article.php

           If the server is using session cookies to track user
           authentication, the above will not work because --save-cookies will
           not save them (and neither will browsers) and the cookies.txt file
           will be empty.  In that case use --keep-session-cookies along with
           --save-cookies to force saving of session cookies.

       --method=HTTP-Method
           For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of other
           HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly set them using
           --header=Header-Line.  Wget will use whatever string is passed to
           it after --method as the HTTP Method to the server.

       --body-data=Data-String
       --body-file=Data-File
           Must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the server
           along with the Method specified using --method.  --body-data sends
           string as data, whereas --body-file sends the contents of file.
           Other than that, they work in exactly the same way.

           Currently, --body-file is not for transmitting files as a whole.
           Wget does not currently support "multipart/form-data" for
           transmitting data; only "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". In the
           future, this may be changed so that wget sends the --body-file as a
           complete file instead of sending its contents to the server. Please
           be aware that Wget needs to know the contents of BODY Data in
           advance, and hence the argument to --body-file should be a regular
           file. See --post-file for a more detailed explanation.  Only one of
           --body-data and --body-file should be specified.

           If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget will
           suspend the current method and send a GET request till the
           redirection is completed.  This is true for all redirection
           response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which is used to
           explicitly specify that the request method should not change.
           Another exception is when the method is set to "POST", in which
           case the redirection rules specified under --post-data are
           followed.

       --content-disposition
           If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support
           for "Content-Disposition" headers is enabled. This can currently
           result in extra round-trips to the server for a "HEAD" request, and
           is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not
           currently enabled by default.

           This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that
           use "Content-Disposition" headers to describe what the name of a
           downloaded file should be.

           When combined with --metalink-over-http and --trust-server-names, a
           Content-Type: application/metalink4+xml file is named using the
           "Content-Disposition" filename field, if available.

       --content-on-error
           If this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when the
           server responds with a http status code that indicates error.

       --trust-server-names
           If this is set, on a redirect, the local file name will be based on
           the redirection URL.  By default the local file name is based on
           the original URL.  When doing recursive retrieving this can be
           helpful because in many web sites redirected URLs correspond to an
           underlying file structure, while link URLs do not.

       --auth-no-challenge
           If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP authentication
           information (plaintext username and password) for all requests,
           just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.

           Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to
           support some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP
           authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say,
           in addition to form-based authentication.

       --retry-on-host-error
           Consider host errors, such as "Temporary failure in name
           resolution", as non-fatal, transient errors.

       --retry-on-http-error=code[,code,...]
           Consider given HTTP response codes as non-fatal, transient errors.
           Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit HTTP response codes as
           argument. Useful to work around special circumstances where retries
           are required, but the server responds with an error code normally
           not retried by Wget. Such errors might be 503 (Service Unavailable)
           and 429 (Too Many Requests). Retries enabled by this option are
           performed subject to the normal retry timing and retry count
           limitations of Wget.

           Using this option is intended to support special use cases only and
           is generally not recommended, as it can force retries even in cases
           where the server is actually trying to decrease its load. Please
           use wisely and only if you know what you are doing.

   HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options
       To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled with
       an external SSL library. The current default is GnuTLS.  In addition,
       Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).  If Wget is
       compiled without SSL support, none of these options are available.

       --secure-protocol=protocol
           Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are auto,
           SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, TLSv1_3 and PFS.  If auto is
           used, the SSL library is given the liberty of choosing the
           appropriate protocol automatically, which is achieved by sending a
           TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.

           Specifying SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2 or TLSv1_3 forces
           the use of the corresponding protocol.  This is useful when talking
           to old and buggy SSL server implementations that make it hard for
           the underlying SSL library to choose the correct protocol version.
           Fortunately, such servers are quite rare.

           Specifying PFS enforces the use of the so-called Perfect Forward
           Security cipher suites. In short, PFS adds security by creating a
           one-time key for each SSL connection. It has a bit more CPU impact
           on client and server.  We use known to be secure ciphers (e.g. no
           MD4) and the TLS protocol. This mode also explicitly excludes non-
           PFS key exchange methods, such as RSA.

       --https-only
           When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.

       --ciphers
           Set the cipher list string. Typically this string sets the cipher
           suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish should be used,
           in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it 'priority string').
           This string will be fed verbatim to the SSL/TLS engine (OpenSSL or
           GnuTLS) and hence its format and syntax is dependent on that. Wget
           will not process or manipulate it in any way. Refer to the OpenSSL
           or GnuTLS documentation for more information.

       --no-check-certificate
           Don't check the server certificate against the available
           certificate authorities.  Also don't require the URL host name to
           match the common name presented by the certificate.

           As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's certificate
           against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL
           handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails.
           Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
           interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
           versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or
           otherwise invalid certificates.  This option forces an "insecure"
           mode of operation that turns the certificate verification errors
           into warnings and allows you to proceed.

           If you encounter "certificate verification" errors or ones saying
           that "common name doesn't match requested host name", you can use
           this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the
           download.  Only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of
           the site's authenticity, or if you really don't care about the
           validity of its certificate.  It is almost always a bad idea not to
           check the certificates when transmitting confidential or important
           data.  For self-signed/internal certificates, you should download
           the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing this
           insecure mode.  If you are really sure of not desiring any
           certificate verification, you can specify --check-certificate=quiet
           to tell wget to not print any warning about invalid certificates,
           albeit in most cases this is the wrong thing to do.

       --certificate=file
           Use the client certificate stored in file.  This is needed for
           servers that are configured to require certificates from the
           clients that connect to them.  Normally a certificate is not
           required and this switch is optional.

       --certificate-type=type
           Specify the type of the client certificate.  Legal values are PEM
           (assumed by default) and DER, also known as ASN1.

       --private-key=file
           Read the private key from file.  This allows you to provide the
           private key in a file separate from the certificate.

       --private-key-type=type
           Specify the type of the private key.  Accepted values are PEM (the
           default) and DER.

       --ca-certificate=file
           Use file as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities
           ("CA") to verify the peers.  The certificates must be in PEM
           format.

           Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the system-
           specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

       --ca-directory=directory
           Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.  Each
           file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is based on a
           hash value derived from the certificate.  This is achieved by
           processing a certificate directory with the "c_rehash" utility
           supplied with OpenSSL.  Using --ca-directory is more efficient than
           --ca-certificate when many certificates are installed because it
           allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.

           Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the system-
           specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

       --crl-file=file
           Specifies a CRL file in file.  This is needed for certificates that
           have been revocated by the CAs.

       --pinnedpubkey=file/hashes
           Tells wget to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to
           verify the peer.  This can be a path to a file which contains a
           single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64
           encoded sha256 hashes preceded by "sha256//" and separated by ";"

           When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a
           certificate indicating its identity. A public key is extracted from
           this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public key(s)
           provided to this option, wget will abort the connection before
           sending or receiving any data.

       --random-file=file
           [OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use file as the source of random data
           for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on systems without
           /dev/urandom.

           On such systems the SSL library needs an external source of
           randomness to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by EGD (see
           --egd-file below) or read from an external source specified by the
           user.  If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random data
           in $RANDFILE or, if that is unset, in $HOME/.rnd.

           If you're getting the "Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling SSL."
           error, you should provide random data using some of the methods
           described above.

       --egd-file=file
           [OpenSSL only] Use file as the EGD socket.  EGD stands for Entropy
           Gathering Daemon, a user-space program that collects data from
           various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to
           other programs that might need it.  Encryption software, such as
           the SSL library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed
           the random number generator used to produce cryptographically
           strong keys.

           OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using
           the "RAND_FILE" environment variable.  If this variable is unset,
           or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness,
           OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket specified using this
           option.

           If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command
           is not used), EGD is never contacted.  EGD is not needed on modern
           Unix systems that support /dev/urandom.

       --no-hsts
           Wget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security, RFC 6797) by
           default.  Use --no-hsts to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-compliant
           UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all the
           "Strict-Transport-Security" headers, and would not enforce any
           existing HSTS policy.

       --hsts-file=file
           By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in ~/.wget-hsts.  You can
           use --hsts-file to override this. Wget will use the supplied file
           as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to the correct HSTS
           database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot parse the provided
           file, the behaviour is unspecified.

           The Wget's HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line contains
           an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a
           "Strict-Transport-Security" header and that therefore has specified
           a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines starting with a dash
           ("#") are ignored by Wget. Please note that in spite of this
           convenient human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS database is
           generally not a good idea.

           An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one or
           more whitespace:

           "<hostname> SP [<port>] SP <include subdomains> SP <created> SP
           <max-age>"

           The hostname and port fields indicate the hostname and port to
           which the given HSTS policy applies. The port field may be zero,
           and it will, in most of the cases. That means that the port number
           will not be taken into account when deciding whether such HSTS
           policy should be applied on a given request (only the hostname will
           be evaluated). When port is different to zero, both the target
           hostname and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy will
           only be applied if both of them match. This feature has been
           included for testing/development purposes only.  The Wget testsuite
           (in testenv/) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the
           purpose of ensuring Wget's correct behaviour. Applying HSTS
           policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC
           6797 (see Appendix B "Differences between HSTS Policy and Same-
           Origin Policy"). Thus, this functionality should not be used in
           production environments and port will typically be zero. The last
           three fields do what they are expected to. The field
           include_subdomains can either be 1 or 0 and it signals whether the
           subdomains of the target domain should be part of the given HSTS
           policy as well. The created and max-age fields hold the timestamp
           values of when such entry was created (first seen by Wget) and the
           HSTS-defined value 'max-age', which states how long should that
           HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds elapsed since the
           timestamp stored in created. Once that time has passed, that HSTS
           policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be removed from
           the database.

           If you supply your own HSTS database via --hsts-file, be aware that
           Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs between the
           HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and those in the
           file. When Wget exits, it effectively updates the HSTS database by
           rewriting the database file with the new entries.

           If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one. This
           file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS entries were
           generated (no "Strict-Transport-Security" headers were sent by any
           of the servers) then no file will be created, not even an empty
           one. This behaviour applies to the default database file
           (~/.wget-hsts) as well: it will not be created until some server
           enforces an HSTS policy.

           Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other Wget
           processes at the same time over the HSTS database. Before dumping
           the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and
           merge the changes.

           Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one is
           discouraged.  For more information about the potential security
           threats arose from such practice, see section 14 "Security
           Considerations" of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9 "Creative
           Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store".

       --warc-file=file
           Use file as the destination WARC file.

       --warc-header=string
           Use string into as the warcinfo record.

       --warc-max-size=size
           Set the maximum size of the WARC files to size.

       --warc-cdx
           Write CDX index files.

       --warc-dedup=file
           Do not store records listed in this CDX file.

       --no-warc-compression
           Do not compress WARC files with GZIP.

       --no-warc-digests
           Do not calculate SHA1 digests.

       --no-warc-keep-log
           Do not store the log file in a WARC record.

       --warc-tempdir=dir
           Specify the location for temporary files created by the WARC
           writer.

   FTP Options
       --ftp-user=user
       --ftp-password=password
           Specify the username user and password password on an FTP server.
           Without this, or the corresponding startup option, the password
           defaults to -wget@, normally used for anonymous FTP.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself.
           Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run
           "ps".  To prevent the passwords from being seen, store them in
           .wgetrc or .netrc, and make sure to protect those files from other
           users with "chmod".  If the passwords are really important, do not
           leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and delete
           them after Wget has started the download.

       --no-remove-listing
           Don't remove the temporary .listing files generated by FTP
           retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
           listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
           useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to
           easily check on the contents of remote server directories (e.g. to
           verify that a mirror you're running is complete).

           Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this
           file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
           .listing a symbolic link to /etc/passwd or something and asking
           "root" to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on the
           options used, either Wget will refuse to write to .listing, making
           the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
           symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual .listing
           file, or the listing will be written to a .listing.number file.

           Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, "root" should
           never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
           something as simple as linking index.html to /etc/passwd and asking
           "root" to run Wget with -N or -r so the file will be overwritten.

       --no-glob
           Turn off FTP globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
           special characters (wildcards), like *, ?, [ and ] to retrieve more
           than one file from the same directory at once, like:

                   wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg

           By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
           globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or
           off permanently.

           You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
           your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
           which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with
           Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix "ls" output).

       --no-passive-ftp
           Disable the use of the passive FTP transfer mode.  Passive FTP
           mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the
           data connection rather than the other way around.

           If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive
           and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and
           NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.
           However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually
           works when passive FTP doesn't.  If you suspect this to be the
           case, use this option, or set "passive_ftp=off" in your init file.

       --preserve-permissions
           Preserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set by
           umask.

       --retr-symlinks
           By default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a
           symbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed and
           the pointed-to files are retrieved.  Currently, Wget does not
           traverse symbolic links to directories to download them
           recursively, though this feature may be added in the future.

           When --retr-symlinks=no is specified, the linked-to file is not
           downloaded.  Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the
           local filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless
           this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
           downloaded it anyway.  This option poses a security risk where a
           malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of
           the intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.

           Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
           specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed
           to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed
           in this case.

   FTPS Options
       --ftps-implicit
           This option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly. Implicit FTPS
           consists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of the
           control connection. This option does not send an "AUTH TLS"
           command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly starts an
           SSL/TLS connection. If the attempt is successful, the session
           continues just like regular FTPS ("PBSZ" and "PROT" are sent,
           etc.).  Implicit FTPS is no longer a requirement for FTPS
           implementations, and thus many servers may not support it. If
           --ftps-implicit is passed and no explicit port number specified,
           the default port for implicit FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of
           the default port for the "normal" (explicit) FTPS which is the same
           as that of FTP, 21.

       --no-ftps-resume-ssl
           Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel. When
           starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS
           session previously started in the control connection.  SSL/TLS
           session resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by
           reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous session. Typically,
           the FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget does this by default.
           Under rare circumstances however, one might want to start an
           entirely new SSL/TLS session in every data connection.  This is
           what --no-ftps-resume-ssl is for.

       --ftps-clear-data-connection
           All the data connections will be in plain text. Only the control
           connection will be under SSL/TLS. Wget will send a "PROT C" command
           to achieve this, which must be approved by the server.

       --ftps-fallback-to-ftp
           Fall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by the target server. For
           security reasons, this option is not asserted by default. The
           default behaviour is to exit with an error.  If a server does not
           successfully reply to the initial "AUTH TLS" command, or in the
           case of implicit FTPS, if the initial SSL/TLS connection attempt is
           rejected, it is considered that such server does not support FTPS.

   Recursive Retrieval Options
       -r
       --recursive
           Turn on recursive retrieving.    The default maximum depth is 5.

       -l depth
       --level=depth
           Set the maximum number of subdirectories that Wget will recurse
           into to depth.  In order to prevent one from accidentally
           downloading very large websites when using recursion this is
           limited to a depth of 5 by default, i.e., it will traverse at most
           5 directories deep starting from the provided URL.  Set -l 0 or -l
           inf for infinite recursion depth.

                   wget -r -l 0 http://<site>/1.html

           Ideally, one would expect this to download just 1.html.  but
           unfortunately this is not the case, because -l 0 is equivalent to
           -l inf---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML
           page (or a handful of them), specify them all on the command line
           and leave away -r and -l. To download the essential items to view a
           single HTML page, see page requisites.

       --delete-after
           This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
           after having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular pages
           through a proxy, e.g.:

                   wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/

           The -r option is to retrieve recursively, and -nd to not create
           directories.

           Note that --delete-after deletes files on the local machine.  It
           does not issue the DELE command to remote FTP sites, for instance.
           Also note that when --delete-after is specified, --convert-links is
           ignored, so .orig files are simply not created in the first place.

       -k
       --convert-links
           After the download is complete, convert the links in the document
           to make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the
           visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to
           external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,
           hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.

           Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

           o   The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be
               changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to
               /bar/img.gif, also downloaded, then the link in doc.html will
               be modified to point to ../bar/img.gif.  This kind of
               transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
               directories.

           o   The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will
               be changed to include host name and absolute path of the
               location they point to.

               Example: if the downloaded file /foo/doc.html links to
               /bar/img.gif (or to ../bar/img.gif), then the link in doc.html
               will be modified to point to http://hostname/bar/img.gif.

           Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file
           was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was
           not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address
           rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former
           links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the
           downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

           Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links
           have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by -k will be
           performed at the end of all the downloads.

       --convert-file-only
           This option converts only the filename part of the URLs, leaving
           the rest of the URLs untouched. This filename part is sometimes
           referred to as the "basename", although we avoid that term here in
           order not to cause confusion.

           It works particularly well in conjunction with --adjust-extension,
           although this coupling is not enforced. It proves useful to
           populate Internet caches with files downloaded from different
           hosts.

           Example: if some link points to //foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz with
           --adjust-extension asserted and its local destination is intended
           to be ./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css, then the link would be converted
           to //foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css. Note that only the filename part has
           been modified. The rest of the URL has been left untouched,
           including the net path ("//") which would otherwise be processed by
           Wget and converted to the effective scheme (ie. "http://").

       -K
       --backup-converted
           When converting a file, back up the original version with a .orig
           suffix.  Affects the behavior of -N.

       -m
       --mirror
           Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
           recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
           keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to -r -N
           -l inf --no-remove-listing.

       -p
       --page-requisites
           This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
           necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes
           such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.

           Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
           documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
           downloaded.  Using -r together with -l can help, but since Wget
           does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
           documents, one is generally left with "leaf documents" that are
           missing their requisites.

           For instance, say document 1.html contains an "<IMG>" tag
           referencing 1.gif and an "<A>" tag pointing to external document
           2.html.  Say that 2.html is similar but that its image is 2.gif and
           it links to 3.html.  Say this continues up to some arbitrarily high
           number.

           If one executes the command:

                   wget -r -l 2 http://<site>/1.html

           then 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, 2.gif, and 3.html will be downloaded.
           As you can see, 3.html is without its requisite 3.gif because Wget
           is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from 1.html in
           order to determine where to stop the recursion.  However, with this
           command:

                   wget -r -l 2 -p http://<site>/1.html

           all the above files and 3.html's requisite 3.gif will be
           downloaded.  Similarly,

                   wget -r -l 1 -p http://<site>/1.html

           will cause 1.html, 1.gif, 2.html, and 2.gif to be downloaded.  One
           might think that:

                   wget -r -l 0 -p http://<site>/1.html

           would download just 1.html and 1.gif, but unfortunately this is not
           the case, because -l 0 is equivalent to -l inf---that is, infinite
           recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a handful of them,
           all specified on the command-line or in a -i URL input file) and
           its (or their) requisites, simply leave off -r and -l:

                   wget -p http://<site>/1.html

           Note that Wget will behave as if -r had been specified, but only
           that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from
           that page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to
           download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist
           on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly
           locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to -p:

                   wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<site>/<document>

           To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
           external document link is any URL specified in an "<A>" tag, an
           "<AREA>" tag, or a "<LINK>" tag other than "<LINK
           REL="stylesheet">".

       --strict-comments
           Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments.  The default is to
           terminate comments at the first occurrence of -->.

           According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as SGML
           declarations.  Declaration is special markup that begins with <!
           and ends with >, such as <!DOCTYPE ...>, that may contain comments
           between a pair of -- delimiters.  HTML comments are "empty
           declarations", SGML declarations without any non-comment text.
           Therefore, <!--foo--> is a valid comment, and so is <!--one--
           --two-->, but <!--1--2--> is not.

           On the other hand, most HTML writers don't perceive comments as
           anything other than text delimited with <!-- and -->, which is not
           quite the same.  For example, something like <!------------> works
           as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple of
           four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next --,
           which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of this,
           many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
           implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
           <!-- and -->.

           Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which
           resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in
           browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant
           comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of
           clients that implements "naive" comments, terminating each comment
           at the first occurrence of -->.

           If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
           option to turn it on.

   Recursive Accept/Reject Options
       -A acclist --accept acclist
       -R rejlist --reject rejlist
           Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
           accept or reject. Note that if any of the wildcard characters, *,
           ?, [ or ], appear in an element of acclist or rejlist, it will be
           treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.  In this case, you have
           to enclose the pattern into quotes to prevent your shell from
           expanding it, like in -A "*.mp3" or -A '*.mp3'.

       --accept-regex urlregex
       --reject-regex urlregex
           Specify a regular expression to accept or reject the complete URL.

       --regex-type regextype
           Specify the regular expression type.  Possible types are posix or
           pcre.  Note that to be able to use pcre type, wget has to be
           compiled with libpcre support.

       -D domain-list
       --domains=domain-list
           Set domains to be followed.  domain-list is a comma-separated list
           of domains.  Note that it does not turn on -H.

       --exclude-domains domain-list
           Specify the domains that are not to be followed.

       --follow-ftp
           Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option, Wget
           will ignore all the FTP links.

       --follow-tags=list
           Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it
           considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
           retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
           considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
           comma-separated list with this option.

       --ignore-tags=list
           This is the opposite of the --follow-tags option.  To skip certain
           HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to download,
           specify them in a comma-separated list.

           In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a single
           page and its requisites, using a command-line like:

                   wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r http://<site>/<document>

           However, the author of this option came across a page with tags
           like "<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">" and came to the realization that
           specifying tags to ignore was not enough.  One can't just tell Wget
           to ignore "<LINK>", because then stylesheets will not be
           downloaded.  Now the best bet for downloading a single page and its
           requisites is the dedicated --page-requisites option.

       --ignore-case
           Ignore case when matching files and directories.  This influences
           the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well as globbing
           implemented when downloading from FTP sites.  For example, with
           this option, -A "*.txt" will match file1.txt, but also file2.TXT,
           file3.TxT, and so on.  The quotes in the example are to prevent the
           shell from expanding the pattern.

       -H
       --span-hosts
           Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.

       -L
       --relative
           Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home
           page without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts.

       -I list
       --include-directories=list
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow
           when downloading.  Elements of list may contain wildcards.

       -X list
       --exclude-directories=list
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude
           from download.  Elements of list may contain wildcards.

       -np
       --no-parent
           Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
           recursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees that
           only the files below a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.

COMMAND: vmstat

DESCRIPTION: vmstat - Report virtual memory statistics

USAGE: vmstat [options] [delay [count]]

OPTIONS:
delay  The delay between updates in seconds.  If no delay is specified,
              only one report is printed with the average values since boot.

       count  Number  of updates.  In absence of count, when delay is defined,
              default is infinite.

       -a, --active
              Display active and  inactive memory, given a  2.5.41  kernel  or
              better.

       -f, --forks
              The -f switch displays the number of forks since boot.  This in-
              cludes the fork, vfork, and clone system calls, and  is  equiva-
              lent to the total number of tasks created.  Each process is rep-
              resented by one or more tasks, depending on thread usage.   This
              display does not repeat.

       -m, --slabs
              Displays slabinfo.

       -n, --one-header
              Display the header only once rather than periodically.

       -s, --stats
              Displays  a  table  of various event counters and memory statis-
              tics.  This display does not repeat.

       -d, --disk
              Report disk statistics (2.5.70 or above required).

       -D, --disk-sum
              Report some summary statistics about disk activity.

       -p, --partition device
              Detailed statistics about partition (2.5.70 or above required).

       -S, --unit character
              Switches outputs between 1000 (k), 1024  (K),  1000000  (m),  or
              1048576  (M)  bytes.  Note this does not change the swap (si/so)
              or block (bi/bo) fields.

       -t, --timestamp
              Append timestamp to each line

       -w, --wide
              Wide output mode (useful for systems with higher amount of  mem-
              ory,  where the default output mode suffers from unwanted column
              breakage).  The output is wider than 80 characters per line.

       -y, --no-first
              Omits first report with statistics since system boot.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

COMMAND: free

DESCRIPTION: free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system

USAGE: free [options]

OPTIONS:
-b, --bytes
              Display the amount of memory in bytes.

       -k, --kibi
              Display the amount of memory in kibibytes.  This is the default.

       -m, --mebi
              Display the amount of memory in mebibytes.

       -g, --gibi
              Display the amount of memory in gibibytes.

       --tebi Display the amount of memory in tebibytes.

       --pebi Display the amount of memory in pebibytes.

       --kilo Display the amount of memory in kilobytes. Implies --si.

       --mega Display the amount of memory in megabytes. Implies --si.

       --giga Display the amount of memory in gigabytes. Implies --si.

       --tera Display the amount of memory in terabytes. Implies --si.

       --peta Display the amount of memory in petabytes. Implies --si.

       -h, --human
              Show  all  output  fields automatically scaled to shortest three
              digit unit and display the units of print out.  Following  units
              are used.

                B = bytes
                Ki = kibibyte
                Mi = mebibyte
                Gi = gibibyte
                Ti = tebibyte
                Pi = pebibyte

              If  unit  is  missing, and you have exbibyte of RAM or swap, the
              number is in tebibytes and columns might  not  be  aligned  with
              header.

       -w, --wide
              Switch  to  the  wide  mode. The wide mode produces lines longer
              than 80 characters. In this mode buffers and cache are  reported
              in two separate columns.

       -c, --count count
              Display the result count times.  Requires the -s option.

       -l, --lohi
              Show detailed low and high memory statistics.

       -s, --seconds delay
              Continuously  display  the result delay  seconds apart.  You may
              actually specify any floating point number for delay  using  ei-
              ther  . or , for decimal point.  usleep(3) is used for microsec-
              ond resolution delay times.

       --si   Use kilo, mega, giga etc (power of 1000) instead of kibi,  mebi,
              gibi (power of 1024).

       -t, --total
              Display a line showing the column totals.

       -v, --committed
              Display  a  line  showing  the memory commit limit and amount of
              committed/uncommitted memory. The total column on this line will
              display the memory commit limit.   This line is relevant if mem-
              ory overcommit is disabled.

       --help Print help.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

COMMAND: mysql

DESCRIPTION: mariadb - the MariaDB command-line tool (mysql is now a symlink to
       mariadb)

USAGE: mysql [options] db_name

OPTIONS:
mysql supports the following options, which can be specified on the
       command line or in the [mysql], [client], [client-server] or [client-
       mariadb] option file groups.  mysql also supports the options for
       processing option files.

       o   --help, -?, -I

           Display a help message and exit.

       o   --abort-source-on-error

           Abort 'source filename' operations in case of errors.

       o   --auto-rehash

           Enable automatic rehashing. This option is on by default, which
           enables database, table, and column name completion. Use
           --disable-auto-rehash, --no-auto-rehash,  or --skip-auto-rehash to
           disable rehashing. That causes mysql to start faster, but you must
           issue the rehash command if you want to use name completion.

           To complete a name, enter the first part and press Tab. If the name
           is unambiguous, mysql completes it. Otherwise, you can press Tab
           again to see the possible names that begin with what you have typed
           so far. Completion does not occur if there is no default database.

       o   --auto-vertical-output

           Automatically switch to vertical output mode if the result is wider
           than the terminal width.

       o   --batch, -B

           Print results using tab as the column separator, with each row on a
           new line. With this option, mysql does not use the history file.

           Batch mode results in nontabular output format and escaping of
           special characters. Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see
           the description for the --raw option.

       o   --binary-mode

           Binary mode allows certain character sequences to be processed as
           data that would otherwise be treated with a special meaning by the
           parser.  Specifically, this switch turns off parsing of all client
           commands except \C and DELIMITER in non-interactive mode (i.e.,
           when binary mode is combined with either 1) piped input, 2) the
           --batch mysql option, or 3) the 'source' command). Also, in binary
           mode, occurrences of '\r\n' and ASCII '\0' are preserved within
           strings, whereas by default, '\r\n' is translated to '\n' and '\0'
           is disallowed in user input.

       o   --character-sets-dir=path

           The directory where character sets are installed.

       o   --column-names

           Write column names in results.

       o   --column-type-info, -m

           Display result set metadata.

       o   --comments, -c

           Whether to preserve comments in statements sent to the server. The
           default is --skip-comments (discard comments), enable with
           --comments (preserve comments).

       o   --compress, -C

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
           both support compression.

       o   --connect-timeout=seconds

           Set the number of seconds before connection timeout. (Default value
           is 0.)

       o   --database=db_name, -D db_name

           The database to use.

       o   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           'd:t:o,file_name'. The default is 'd:t:o,/tmp/mysql.trace'.

       o   --debug-check

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       o   --debug-info, -T

           Prints debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
           when the program exits.

       o   --default-auth=name

           Default authentication client-side plugin to use.

       o   --default-character-set=charset_name

           Use charset_name as the default character set for the client and
           connection.

           A common issue that can occur when the operating system uses utf8
           or another multi-byte character set is that output from the mysql
           client is formatted incorrectly, due to the fact that the MariaDB
           client uses the latin1 character set by default. You can usually
           fix such issues by using this option to force the client to use the
           system character set instead.

       o   --defaults-extra-file=filename

           Set filename as the file to read default options from after the
           global defaults files has been read.  Must be given as first
           option.

       o   --defaults-file=filename

           Set filename as the file to read default options from, override
           global defaults files. Must be given as first option.

       o   --defaults-group-suffix=suffix

           In addition to the groups named on the command line, read groups
           that have the given suffix.

       o   --delimiter=str

           Set the statement delimiter. The default is the semicolon character
           (";").

       o   --disable-named-commands

           Disable named commands. Use the \* form only, or use named commands
           only at the beginning of a line ending with a semicolon (";").
           mysql starts with this option enabled by default. However, even
           with this option, long-format commands still work from the first
           line. See the section called "MYSQL COMMANDS".

       o   --enable-cleartext-plugin

           Obsolete option. Exists only for MySQL compatibility.

       o   --execute=statement, -e statement

           Execute the statement and quit. Disables --force and history file.
           The default output format is like that produced with --batch.

       o   --force, -f

           Continue even if an SQL error occurs. Sets --abort-source-on-error
           to 0.

       o   --host=host_name, -h host_name

           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.

       o   --html, -H

           Produce HTML output.

       o   --ignore-spaces, -i

           Ignore spaces after function names. Allows one to have spaces
           (including tab characters and new line characters) between function
           name and '('. The drawback is that this causes built in functions
           to become reserved words.

       o   --init-command=str

           SQL Command to execute when connecting to the MariaDB server. Will
           automatically be re-executed when reconnecting.

       o   --line-numbers

           Write line numbers for errors. Disable this with
           --skip-line-numbers.

       o   --local-infile[={0|1}]

           Enable or disable LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA INFILE. With no
           value, the option enables LOCAL. The option may be given as
           --local-infile=0 or --local-infile=1 to explicitly disable or
           enable LOCAL. Enabling LOCAL has no effect if the server does not
           also support it.

       o   --max-allowed-packet=num

           Set the maximum packet length to send to or receive from the
           server. (Default value is 16MB, largest 1GB.)

       o   --max-join-size=num

           Set the automatic limit for rows in a join when using
           --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000,000.)

       o   --named-commands, -G

           Enable named mysql commands. Long-format commands are allowed, not
           just short-format commands. For example, quit and \q both are
           recognized. Use --skip-named-commands to disable named commands.
           See the section called "MYSQL COMMANDS". Disabled by default.

       o   --net-buffer-length=size

           Set the buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. (Default
           value is 16KB.)

       o   --no-auto-rehash, -A

           This has the same effect as --skip-auto-rehash. See the description
           for --auto-rehash.

       o   --no-beep, -b

           Do not beep when errors occur.

       o   --no-defaults

           Do not read default options from any option file. This must be
           given as the first argument.

       o   --one-database, -o

           Ignore statements except those those that occur while the default
           database is the one named on the command line. This filtering is
           limited, and based only on USE statements. This is useful for
           skipping updates to other databases in the binary log.

       o   --pager[=command]

           Use the given command for paging query output. If the command is
           omitted, the default pager is the value of your PAGER environment
           variable. Valid pagers are less, more, cat [> filename], and so
           forth. This option works only on Unix and only in interactive mode.
           To disable paging, use --skip-pager.  the section called "MYSQL
           COMMANDS", discusses output paging further.

       o   --password[=password], -p[password]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the option
           and the password. If you omit the password value following the
           --password or -p option on the command line, mysql prompts for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.

       o   --pipe, -W

           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       o   --plugin-dir=dir_name

           Directory for client-side plugins.

       o   --port=port_num, -P port_num

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection or 0 for default
           to, in order of preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT, /etc/services,
           built-in default (3306).  Forces --protocol=tcp when specified on
           the command line without other connection properties.

       o   --print-defaults

           Print the program argument list and exit. This must be given as the
           first argument.

       o   --progress-reports

           Get progress reports for long running commands (such as ALTER
           TABLE). (Defaults to on; use --skip-progress-reports to disable.)

       o   --prompt=format_str

           Set the prompt to the specified format. The special sequences that
           the prompt can contain are described in the section called "MYSQL
           COMMANDS".

       o   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
           useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
           protocol to be used other than the one you want.

       o   --quick, -q

           Do not cache each query result, print each row as it is received.
           This may slow down the server if the output is suspended. With this
           option, mysql does not use the history file.

       o   --raw, -r

           For tabular output, the "boxing" around columns enables one column
           value to be distinguished from another. For nontabular output (such
           as is produced in batch mode or when the --batch or --silent option
           is given), special characters are escaped in the output so they can
           be identified easily. Newline, tab, NUL, and backslash are written
           as \n, \t, \0, and \\. The --raw option disables this character
           escaping.

           The following example demonstrates tabular versus nontabular output
           and the use of raw mode to disable escaping:

               % mysql
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               +----------+
               | CHAR(92) |
               +----------+
               | \        |
               +----------+
               % mysql -s
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               CHAR(92)
               \\
               % mysql -s -r
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               CHAR(92)
               \

       o   --reconnect

           If the connection to the server is lost, automatically try to
           reconnect. A single reconnect attempt is made each time the
           connection is lost. Enabled by default, to disable use
           --skip-reconnect or --disable-reconnect.

       o   --safe-updates, --i-am-a-dummy, -U

           Allow only those UPDATE and DELETE statements that specify which
           rows to modify by using key values. If you have set this option in
           an option file, you can override it by using --safe-updates on the
           command line. See the section called "MYSQL TIPS", for more
           information about this option.

       o   --secure-auth

           Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1.1) format. This
           prevents connections except for servers that use the newer password
           format.

       o   --select-limit=limit

           Set automatic limit for SELECT when using --safe-updates. (Default
           value is 1,000.)

       o   --server-arg=name

           Send name as a parameter to the embedded server.

       o   --show-warnings

           Cause warnings to be shown after each statement if there are any.
           This option applies to interactive and batch mode.

       o   --sigint-ignore

           Ignore SIGINT signals (typically the result of typing Control-C).

       o   --silent, -s

           Silent mode. Produce less output. This option can be given multiple
           times to produce less and less output.

           This option results in nontabular output format and escaping of
           special characters. Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see
           the description for the --raw option.

       o   --skip-auto-rehash

           Disable automatic rehashing. Synonym for --disable-auto-rehash.

       o   --skip-column-names, -N

           Do not write column names in results.

       o   --skip-line-numbers, -L

           Do not write line numbers for errors. Useful when you want to
           compare result files that include error messages.

       o   --socket=path, -S path

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.  Forces
           --protocol=socket when specified on the command line without other
           connection properties; on Windows, forces --protocol=pipe.

       o   --ssl

           Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with other flags).
           Disable with --skip-ssl.

       o   --ssl-ca=name

           CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-capath=name

           CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-cert=name

           X509 cert in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-cipher=name

           SSL cipher to use (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-key=name

           X509 key in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-crl=name

           Certificate revocation list (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       o   --ssl-crlpath=name

           Certificate revocation list path (check OpenSSL docs, implies
           --ssl).

       o   --ssl-verify-server-cert

           Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against hostname used
           when connecting. This option is disabled by default.

       o   --table, -t

           Display output in table format. This is the default for interactive
           use, but can be used to produce table output in batch mode.

       o   --tee=file_name

           Append a copy of output to the given file. This option works only
           in interactive mode.  the section called "MYSQL COMMANDS",
           discusses tee files further.

       o   --unbuffered, -n

           Flush the buffer after each query.

       o   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.

       o   --verbose, -v

           Verbose mode. Produce more output about what the program does. This
           option can be given multiple times to produce more and more output.
           (For example, -v -v -v produces table output format even in batch
           mode.)

       o   --version, -V

           Display version information and exit.

       o   --vertical, -E

           Print query output rows vertically (one line per column value).
           Without this option, you can specify vertical output for individual
           statements by terminating them with \G.

       o   --wait, -w

           If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead of
           aborting.

       o   --xml, -X

           Produce XML output.  The output when --xml is used with mysql
           matches that of mysqldump --xml. See mysqldump(1) for details.

           The XML output also uses an XML namespace, as shown here:

               shell> mysql --xml -uroot -e "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'"
               <?xml version="1.0"?>
               <resultset statement="SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version%'" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version</field>
               <field name="Value">5.0.40-debug</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_comment</field>
               <field name="Value">Source distribution</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_compile_machine</field>
               <field name="Value">i686</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_compile_os</field>
               <field name="Value">suse-linux-gnu</field>
               </row>
               </resultset>

           You can also set the following variables by using --var_name=value.

           o   connect_timeout

               The number of seconds before connection timeout. (Default value
               is 0.)

           o   max_allowed_packet

               The maximum packet length to send to or receive from the
               server. (Default value is 16MB.)

           o   max_join_size

               The automatic limit for rows in a join when using
               --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000,000.)

           o   net_buffer_length

               The buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. (Default
               value is 16KB.)

           o   select_limit

               The automatic limit for SELECT statements when using
               --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000.)

           On Unix, the mysql client writes a record of executed statements to
           a history file. By default, this file is named .mysql_history and
           is created in your home directory. To specify a different file, set
           the value of the MYSQL_HISTFILE environment variable.

           The .mysql_history should be protected with a restrictive access
           mode because sensitive information might be written to it, such as
           the text of SQL statements that contain passwords.

           If you do not want to maintain a history file, first remove
           .mysql_history if it exists, and then use either of the following
           techniques:

           o   Set the MYSQL_HISTFILE variable to /dev/null. To cause this
               setting to take effect each time you log in, put the setting in
               one of your shell's startup files.

           o   Create .mysql_history as a symbolic link to /dev/null:

                   shell> ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history

               You need do this only once.

EXECUTION EXAMPLE:

COMMAND: psql

DESCRIPTION: psql - PostgreSQL interactive terminal

USAGE: psql [option...] [dbname [username]]

OPTIONS:
-a
       --echo-all
           Print all nonempty input lines to standard output as they are read.
           (This does not apply to lines read interactively.) This is
           equivalent to setting the variable ECHO to all.

       -A
       --no-align
           Switches to unaligned output mode. (The default output mode is
           aligned.) This is equivalent to \pset format unaligned.

       -b
       --echo-errors
           Print failed SQL commands to standard error output. This is
           equivalent to setting the variable ECHO to errors.

       -c command
       --command=command
           Specifies that psql is to execute the given command string,
           command. This option can be repeated and combined in any order with
           the -f option. When either -c or -f is specified, psql does not
           read commands from standard input; instead it terminates after
           processing all the -c and -f options in sequence.

           command must be either a command string that is completely parsable
           by the server (i.e., it contains no psql-specific features), or a
           single backslash command. Thus you cannot mix SQL and psql
           meta-commands within a -c option. To achieve that, you could use
           repeated -c options or pipe the string into psql, for example:

               psql -c '\x' -c 'SELECT * FROM foo;'

           or

               echo '\x \\ SELECT * FROM foo;' | psql

           (\\ is the separator meta-command.)

           Each SQL command string passed to -c is sent to the server as a
           single request. Because of this, the server executes it as a single
           transaction even if the string contains multiple SQL commands,
           unless there are explicit BEGIN/COMMIT commands included in the
           string to divide it into multiple transactions. (See
           Section 55.2.2.1 for more details about how the server handles
           multi-query strings.)

           If having several commands executed in one transaction is not
           desired, use repeated -c commands or feed multiple commands to
           psql's standard input, either using echo as illustrated above, or
           via a shell here-document, for example:

               psql <<EOF
               \x
               SELECT * FROM foo;
               EOF

       --csv
           Switches to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) output mode. This is
           equivalent to \pset format csv.

       -d dbname
       --dbname=dbname
           Specifies the name of the database to connect to. This is
           equivalent to specifying dbname as the first non-option argument on
           the command line. The dbname can be a connection string. If so,
           connection string parameters will override any conflicting command
           line options.

       -e
       --echo-queries
           Copy all SQL commands sent to the server to standard output as
           well. This is equivalent to setting the variable ECHO to queries.

       -E
       --echo-hidden
           Echo the actual queries generated by \d and other backslash
           commands. You can use this to study psql's internal operations.
           This is equivalent to setting the variable ECHO_HIDDEN to on.

       -f filename
       --file=filename
           Read commands from the file filename, rather than standard input.
           This option can be repeated and combined in any order with the -c
           option. When either -c or -f is specified, psql does not read
           commands from standard input; instead it terminates after
           processing all the -c and -f options in sequence. Except for that,
           this option is largely equivalent to the meta-command \i.

           If filename is - (hyphen), then standard input is read until an EOF
           indication or \q meta-command. This can be used to intersperse
           interactive input with input from files. Note however that Readline
           is not used in this case (much as if -n had been specified).

           Using this option is subtly different from writing psql < filename.
           In general, both will do what you expect, but using -f enables some
           nice features such as error messages with line numbers. There is
           also a slight chance that using this option will reduce the
           start-up overhead. On the other hand, the variant using the shell's
           input redirection is (in theory) guaranteed to yield exactly the
           same output you would have received had you entered everything by
           hand.

       -F separator
       --field-separator=separator
           Use separator as the field separator for unaligned output. This is
           equivalent to \pset fieldsep or \f.

       -h hostname
       --host=hostname
           Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is
           running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the
           directory for the Unix-domain socket.

       -H
       --html
           Switches to HTML output mode. This is equivalent to \pset format
           html or the \H command.

       -l
       --list
           List all available databases, then exit. Other non-connection
           options are ignored. This is similar to the meta-command \list.

           When this option is used, psql will connect to the database
           postgres, unless a different database is named on the command line
           (option -d or non-option argument, possibly via a service entry,
           but not via an environment variable).

       -L filename
       --log-file=filename
           Write all query output into file filename, in addition to the
           normal output destination.

       -n
       --no-readline
           Do not use Readline for line editing and do not use the command
           history (see the section called "Command-Line Editing" below).

       -o filename
       --output=filename
           Put all query output into file filename. This is equivalent to the
           command \o.

       -p port
       --port=port
           Specifies the TCP port or the local Unix-domain socket file
           extension on which the server is listening for connections.
           Defaults to the value of the PGPORT environment variable or, if not
           set, to the port specified at compile time, usually 5432.

       -P assignment
       --pset=assignment
           Specifies printing options, in the style of \pset. Note that here
           you have to separate name and value with an equal sign instead of a
           space. For example, to set the output format to LaTeX, you could
           write -P format=latex.

       -q
       --quiet
           Specifies that psql should do its work quietly. By default, it
           prints welcome messages and various informational output. If this
           option is used, none of this happens. This is useful with the -c
           option. This is equivalent to setting the variable QUIET to on.

       -R separator
       --record-separator=separator
           Use separator as the record separator for unaligned output. This is
           equivalent to \pset recordsep.

       -s
       --single-step
           Run in single-step mode. That means the user is prompted before
           each command is sent to the server, with the option to cancel
           execution as well. Use this to debug scripts.

       -S
       --single-line
           Runs in single-line mode where a newline terminates an SQL command,
           as a semicolon does.

               Note
               This mode is provided for those who insist on it, but you are
               not necessarily encouraged to use it. In particular, if you mix
               SQL and meta-commands on a line the order of execution might
               not always be clear to the inexperienced user.

       -t
       --tuples-only
           Turn off printing of column names and result row count footers,
           etc. This is equivalent to \t or \pset tuples_only.

       -T table_options
       --table-attr=table_options
           Specifies options to be placed within the HTML table tag. See \pset
           tableattr for details.

       -U username
       --username=username
           Connect to the database as the user username instead of the
           default. (You must have permission to do so, of course.)

       -v assignment
       --set=assignment
       --variable=assignment
           Perform a variable assignment, like the \set meta-command. Note
           that you must separate name and value, if any, by an equal sign on
           the command line. To unset a variable, leave off the equal sign. To
           set a variable with an empty value, use the equal sign but leave
           off the value. These assignments are done during command line
           processing, so variables that reflect connection state will get
           overwritten later.

       -V
       --version
           Print the psql version and exit.

       -w
       --no-password
           Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password
           authentication and a password is not available from other sources
           such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This
           option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is
           present to enter a password.

           Note that this option will remain set for the entire session, and
           so it affects uses of the meta-command \connect as well as the
           initial connection attempt.

       -W
       --password
           Force psql to prompt for a password before connecting to a
           database, even if the password will not be used.

           If the server requires password authentication and a password is
           not available from other sources such as a .pgpass file, psql will
           prompt for a password in any case. However, psql will waste a
           connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In
           some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the extra connection
           attempt.

           Note that this option will remain set for the entire session, and
           so it affects uses of the meta-command \connect as well as the
           initial connection attempt.

       -x
       --expanded
           Turn on the expanded table formatting mode. This is equivalent to
           \x or \pset expanded.

       -X
       --no-psqlrc
           Do not read the start-up file (neither the system-wide psqlrc file
           nor the user's ~/.psqlrc file).

       -z
       --field-separator-zero
           Set the field separator for unaligned output to a zero byte. This
           is equivalent to \pset fieldsep_zero.

       -0
       --record-separator-zero
           Set the record separator for unaligned output to a zero byte. This
           is useful for interfacing, for example, with xargs -0. This is
           equivalent to \pset recordsep_zero.

       -1
       --single-transaction
           This option can only be used in combination with one or more -c
           and/or -f options. It causes psql to issue a BEGIN command before
           the first such option and a COMMIT command after the last one,
           thereby wrapping all the commands into a single transaction. If any
           of the commands fails and the variable ON_ERROR_STOP was set, a
           ROLLBACK command is sent instead. This ensures that either all the
           commands complete successfully, or no changes are applied.

           If the commands themselves contain BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK, this
           option will not have the desired effects. Also, if an individual
           command cannot be executed inside a transaction block, specifying
           this option will cause the whole transaction to fail.

       -?
       --help[=topic]
           Show help about psql and exit. The optional topic parameter
           (defaulting to options) selects which part of psql is explained:
           commands describes psql's backslash commands; options describes the
           command-line options that can be passed to psql; and variables
           shows help about psql configuration variables.

COMMAND: find

DESCRIPTION: find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

                     ceeded or failed.

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.

USAGE: find  [-H]  [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [ex-
       pression]

OPTIONS:
The -H, -L and -P options control  the  treatment  of  symbolic  links.
       Command-line  arguments  following these are taken to be names of files
       or directories to be examined, up to the  first  argument  that  begins
       with  `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following
       arguments are taken to be the  expression  describing  what  is  to  be
       searched  for.   If  no paths are given, the current directory is used.
       If no expression is given, the  expression  -print  is  used  (but  you
       should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options' within the expression list.
       These options control the behaviour of find but are  specified  immedi-
       ately after the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D
       and -O must appear before the first path name, if  at  all.   A  double
       dash  -- could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining argu-
       ments are not options, but this does not really work  due  to  the  way
       find  determines  the end of the following path arguments: it does that
       by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').   Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would
       treat it as expression argument instead.   Thus,  to  ensure  that  all
       start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
       patterns expanded by the calling shell are not  mistakenly  treated  as
       expression  arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or du-
       bious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names  start-
       ing  with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable
       to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to
       find.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.   This is the default behaviour.
              When find examines or prints information about  files,  and  the
              file  is  a  symbolic  link, the information used shall be taken
              from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information
              about  files, the information used shall be taken from the prop-
              erties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link
              itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to
              examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this  option
              implies  -noleaf.   If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will
              still be in effect.  If -L is in effect  and  find  discovers  a
              symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirec-
              tory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always
              match  against  the type of the file that a symbolic link points
              to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is bro-
              ken).   Actions  that  can cause symbolic links to become broken
              while find is executing (for example -delete) can give  rise  to
              confusing  behaviour.   Using  -L  causes the -lname and -ilname
              predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing  the  com-
              mand  line  arguments.  When find examines or prints information
              about files, the information used shall be taken from the  prop-
              erties  of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this
              behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym-
              bolic  link,  and the link can be resolved.  For that situation,
              the information used is taken from whatever the link  points  to
              (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link
              itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the  sym-
              bolic  link  cannot  be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of
              the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a
              directory,  the  contents  of  that  directory  will be examined
              (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the oth-
       ers; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it
       is the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect  un-
       less either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find  frequently  stats files during the processing of the command
       line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect
       how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a  file  we
       are  currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the
       command line will have been examined and some of  its  properties  will
       have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
       -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L  were  specified),  the
       information  used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties
       of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the  properties
       of  the  file  the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for
       example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to  a
       nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When  the  -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as
       the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be
       taken  from  the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same con-
       sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The -follow option has a similar effect to -L, though it  takes  effect
       at  the  point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow
       is, any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print  diagnostic  information;  this can be helpful to diagnose
              problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of
              debug  options  should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the
              debug options is not guaranteed between releases  of  findutils.
              For  a  complete  list of valid debug options, see the output of
              find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec,  -execdir,
                     -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic  information relating to the optimisa-
                     tion of the expression tree; see the -O option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate suc-
                     ceeded or failed.

              search Navigate the directory tree verbosely.

              stat   Print  messages  as  files are examined with the stat and
                     lstat system calls.  The find program tries  to  minimise
                     such calls.

              tree   Show  the  expression  tree in its original and optimised
                     form.

              all    Enable all of the other debug options (but help).

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests  to
              speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,
              predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to  each
              other.   The  optimisations performed at each optimisation level
              are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to
                     the  traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so
                     that tests based only on the names of files (for  example
                     -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any  -type  or -xtype tests are performed after any tests
                     based only on the names of files, but  before  any  tests
                     that  require information from the inode.  On many modern
                     versions of Unix, file types are  returned  by  readdir()
                     and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than pred-
                     icates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the
                     -fstype FOO  predicate  and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in  `/etc/mtab')  at
                     the  time  find  starts,  that predicate is equivalent to
                     -false.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query op-
                     timiser  is  enabled.   The order of tests is modified so
                     that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
                     expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within
                     each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
                     according  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.
                     For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evalu-
                     ated  earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to
                     fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed  idea  of  how  likely  any
              given  test  is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes
              account of the specific nature of the test (for example, -type f
              is  assumed  to  be  more  likely to succeed than -type c).  The
              cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If  it  does
              not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed
              again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, ro-
              bust  and  effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
              over time.  However, the default  behaviour  (i.e.  optimisation
              level  1)  will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
              findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each  optimi-
              sation level and ensures that the result is the same.
